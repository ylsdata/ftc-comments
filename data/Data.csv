Trying to be brief, candid, and effective with this.  Please see the attached public comments and outreach efforts.  Also, please reference any emails or online submission from or  or  or  . There has also been mailed in documentation. To the FTC.  All of this information address this exact issue as well as resolutions to the questions in your document outline.

Concerning those questions. Yes, they are all resolvable and have been considered as well as others.  Unfortunately, being a victim of such extensive surveillance it is unwise for me to present those digitally. There are also many more questions that are more critical that need to be addressed as well concerning resolution formation. 

That being said I will be very candid here.  There is an opportunity here, that if missed, ignored, or delayed may cause huge problems. I can not emphasize this enough.  Immediate contact and collaborative communication is needed. I plead with you to contact me, . This is important on a global scale for successful technology implementation and security  “Commercial Surveillance ANPR, R111004” , surveillance and further advancement efforts.

I have included some industry and societal efforts.  Please know there is also a Patent that is disignated for this purpose, it has been requested several times to be able to help.  The video is to large to attach.  You have these videos they were from public comment sessions to the FTC, September 2021, October 2021, and November 2021. Jon Wickizer as the presenter.  

Again, I plead with you to listen and choose to respond.  This needs to happen quickly.

Much Hope,

One class of product in particular puts disabled users at more risk for data harvesting.

An accessibility overlay refers to technologies meant to improve the accessibility of a web site. This is usually done by referencing code from another site, which the user’s browser retrieves and applies to the current page on each visit. In an ideal scenario, this makes the page more accessible and means a user does not need to ask for help (itself a privacy risk).

Accessibility overlays are in a unique position because they gather more non-HIPAA health data (https://news.bloomberglaw.com/health-law-and-business/insight-the-top-five-health-care-privacy-issues-to-watch-in-2020#:~:text=Non%2DHIPAA%20Health%20Data) than the typical web site. They are generally marketed to site owners as a legal risk mitigation solution, not a vehicle for users to disclose their disabilities.

Asking users to self-identify is built into accessibility overlay interfaces. They prompt users if they are using a screen reader, have dyslexia, or match pre-defined profiles such as ADHD, vision impaired, prone to seizures, and so on. In some cases, the overlay makes a guess based on how the user interacts with the page. The attached image shows part of an overlay, with toggles for each of: Vision-impaired profile, ADHD friendly profile, and Cognitive disability profile.

Unlike a user of a social media service, who agrees to the platform’s Terms of Service before accessing it, a user who visits a web site with an accessibility overlay has no opportunity to decline the service before it starts to gather information about them. Many users may not even recognize that the overlay has Terms that are distinct from the site they are visiting, governed under laws from a different locality. Assuming the site has its own Terms.

As profiles or settings follow overlay users across sites, more information is gathered about their surfing habits. That information can be paired with the non-HIPAA health data the overlay vendor is capturing, with no clear way to opt out.

This means accessibility overlay vendors are stewards of a great deal of personal information from users. Users who may not understand they have given up that information. Information that can be valuable to data brokers. Even if the best actors in the space have a good privacy policy, that privacy policy is moot in the face of a data breach.

Anonymizing this non-HIPAA health data gathered from users is insufficient because de-anonymizing it is trivial — 99.98% of users can be identified with only 15 data points:

“[W]e find that 99.98% of Americans would be correctly re-identified in any dataset using 15 demographic attributes. Our results suggest that even heavily sampled anonymized datasets are unlikely to satisfy the modern standards for anonymization…”
— Estimating the success of re-identifications in incomplete datasets using generative models, 23 July 2019, Nature, https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10933-3

The risk, real or perceived, to users is compounded by the historic behavior of the current overlay vendors. Disabled users have repeatedly raised concerns (https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7az74/people-with-disabilities-say-this-ai-tool-is-making-the-web-worse-for-them) about the validity of overlays (https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/innovation/blind-people-advocates-slam-company-claiming-make-websites-ada-compliant-n1266720), relationship with the community (https://www.numerama.com/politique/759804-faciliti-la-solution-pour-linclusion-en-ligne-qui-refuse-la-critique.html), marketing promises (https://www.wired.com/story/company-tapped-ai-website-landed-court/), and overall effectiveness (https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/13/technology/ai-web-accessibility.html), to the point the National Federation of the Blind disavowed them (https://www.forbes.com/sites/gusalexiou/2021/06/26/largest-us-blind-advocacy-group-bans-web-accessibility-overlay-giant-accessibe/). One never responded to a DPIA request under GDPR (https://tink.uk/accessibe-and-data-protection/) from a British user.

700+ digital accessibility practitioners, experts, end users, researchers, and more have signed an open letter (https://overlayfactsheet.com/) imploring companies not to use overlays. There is a site dedicated to cataloguing the false marketing claims (https://overlayfalseclaims.com/) of overlay companies.

Many tech-savvy disabled users genuinely do not trust accessibility overlay vendors. Users who understand them are constantly wary they may visit a site where an overlay is installed, potentially matching up any information on file with browsing patterns, and making their disability status available to anyone willing to pay.

Previously, changes in preferences were uniform and intuitive.  Red is deny access, typically with adjustment of toggle to the left.  Accept, green, toggle to the right.

Now that it appears to be a requirement, entities asking preferences are using a variety of colors including counterintuitive colors, i.e. grey as the left toggle, presumably being decline, and red as the right toggle, presumably being accept.  There is no documentation in this selection to define the parameters of acceptance.  It is deliberate obfuscation to attempt to manipulate to accept all cookies 

Proposal:

#1. Remove the ""accept all cookies"" initial button.
Make all people select their cookie preferences.  Ok to continue the prefilled ""strictly necessary cookies"".

#2. Legislate that all cookie preference toggles must be red, select to the left meaning, turn off or decline.  All acceptance responses must be green, to the right, accept or turning.

Corporate America has bought the politicians, courts, laws, regulations, and power to steal from Americans. I trust the democrats someone like elizabeth warren or Bernie to protect Americans privacy. The republicans you cant trust cause everything out of their mouths are a lie and when they have a majority the first thing they do is give themselves a permanent tax cut. The democrats first thing they did was pass an infrastructure plan and health care.
The system is rigged so you have to do a lot of important financial and health stuff on line. There is no escaping it and we really dont have a choice not to enter our data. Try putting in N/A for a phone or other data point, it rarely works and they really dont need it.

It is similar to insurance companies or tax preparers who lobby or buy the politicians who then pass laws requiring proof of insurance, or obstruction free tax filing. I trust the democrats to put the hundreds of millions of consumers first. Make data anonymous after it's use, regulate and pass laws like countries who care about their constituents more than the greedy, thieving corporations. The laws should have stiff penalties for this white collar crime like mandatory jail sentences, and three strikes you are out. The white collar criminals have been protected too long by the enabling congress.

We need a government that puts Americans privacy and well being far ahead of corporate interests. Let's yoke corporate America and make them blind to our information. Then Americans must be compensated for all the theft of our information. I imagine seizing assets and distributing to all of us who have been the victims of fraud because politicians let business steal our information.

You are right in thinking most Americans dont know their information is being bought and sold, because they trusted government and companies to use the information for one use.

Many of us know we are being scammed ,we pay something like 4 trillion in tax revenue every year. It's no wonder you have con men like trump who want to president and direct that money right to his and his family and republican friends wallets, projects, or whatever. They dont love America they love Americans tax dollars. If trump loved America he would have gone to Vietnam and paid his taxes.",,,,,,,

I have had my data exposed multiple times in publicized security breaches and in almost every case I have been left wondering ""why did they need that info? and why did they keep if for so long?""

I believe that in general, companies should only be allowed to gather data relevant to the transaction being carried out by the customer, and the data should only be retained for the period of time that the goods or services in question are in use or under warranty. For example, credit card details for a grocery store purchase could be stored for several months to allow customers to be notified in the case of a recall, or customer info for an electronics purchase could be retained for the length of the warranty.  Attempts to bypass these restrictions by incentivizing customers to join ""loyalty"" programs should be heavily restricted or prohibited.

I also support the implementation of a nation-wide equivalent to the european GDPR to allow people to better control the information that they do share with various companies. All major corporations have already implemented the technology necessary to comply with the european laws (and the new California data privacy laws), it is just a matter of flipping a switch to turn it on for the rest of us.",,,,,,,

If that's not possible (i.e. the FTC is unwilling to enforce that), the very least that should be done is force companies to make it very clear what data is being collected, how that data is used, and how users can opt out of data collection and/or use. Additionally companies should be required to allow users to easily opt out of data collection and/or use online without creating an account or giving up any more personal data.

My name is Jennifer Bell I am an anti-junk mail advocate. It is so difficult to opt-out of mailing lists I had to create a blog to teach people how to do it https://wordpress.com/post/drowndinginmail.wordpress.com/3679 there is an app PaperKarma that helps people stop junk mail. Neither of these things should exist. Direct marketers share and sell people’s data so much that a relative of mine received 130 pieces of mail weekly. This included 16 mailpieces from one “charity” every week. Each mailpiece represented a different mailing list she was on. The greedy “charity” didn’t care about “clean data” and making sure that she was only sent one mailpiece. They only cared about the check she would send for each mailpiece she got from them.

Association of National Advertisers’ DMA Choice program is a joke. (Question 2.) It only stops direct mail from people you have never had a transaction with. And mailing lists can easily be non-DMA Choice compliant. Look up list #486436 Make America Great Mailing List on NextMark You can clearly see on the right-hand side of the page that the list is non-DMA Choice compliant. If you sent money to Ben Carson the rest of the conservative charity world is feasting on you and your mailbox. (Question 4, 5, 6) 

The other data nightmare I would like to talk about is removing a dead person from mailing lists. The way people have to do it now is evil. It is a patchwork list of unofficial things you can do. You hand a Change of Address Card with DEAD on it to your local post office and hope your mail carrier remembers not to deliver the mail for a dead relative. You have to ask each data broker individually and even then it doesn’t work. I still get mail for a person who died 8 years ago. The main reason is that the “deceased do not mail list” costs hundreds of dollars to buy. https://www.ims-dm.com/mvc/page/deceased-lists/ 

What I would like to see is a one-stop shop for opting out of all data brokers. The Opt-out Pre Screen program is a good model to start with. We need to put an end to DMA compliant and Non-DMA Compliant mailing lists. All lists should comply with people wanting to opt-out of direct mail. 
There also needs to be a one-stop shop for stopping mail for the deceased. There has to be a way for the post office to make a name and address combo non-deliverable. 

I live in California and I love the changes that the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) has made to data privacy. If that program could go national, it would be a very good thing for consumers. 

I have attached 2 photos so that people can see what happens when your data is weaponized and starts attacking you. The first photo is of the living room of a person who got 130 mailpieces a week. The second is of 16 mailpieces sent in one week from Policy Issues Institute a political ""charity"".

The fiction of ""consent"" - requirements to agree to long, legalistic statements in order to use a service - masks deeply unequal relationships between a handful of corporations and the public, and that inequality makes many feel they have no choice but to surrender the details of their lives. Moreover, data gathering and automated decision-making influence important functions that influence our lives: whether we can go to college, get a job, get a loan, be able to access social services, pass an exam without being accused of cheating, or get a judicial sentence that isn't influenced by biased data. 

As a (now-retired) librarian and educator, I tried to teach college students how to protect their privacy while also making clear this is not something that should be the responsibility of individuals, it's a problem we need to address as a society. My colleagues and I studied students' understanding and concerns and learned they are not complacent: they are deeply frustrated by the ways their privacy is invaded, but they feel unable to opt out. (""Information Literacy in the Age of Algorithms"" https://projectinfolit.org/publications/algorithm-study/)

I'm pleased the FTC is exploring rule making that might level the playing field between those who profit from violating privacy at scale and the general public. I hope rules can be crafted that would address the harmful effects of irresponsible data gathering and deployment. I would further hope we reconsider the ways this profligate data-hoarding is tapped into by law enforcement and other government entities, often by purchasing services or information from the private sector. Privacy is a necessary condition for living and acting as free human beings in a democracy. It's time to find a better balance. ",,,,,,,

We strive to think critically of existing products and services, as well as conduct research into these solutions and how well they are meeting Customer needs. This positions us within a uniquely low bias point of view at the intersection of privacy, security, and accessibility. Some trends or dark patterns we have noticed across the industry include:

Enacting data privacy and consumer protections from a non-altruistic point of view: An example we see is from Apple, who strives to position themselves as the industry leader in terms of privacy and security protections. While these are marketed as intended for Consumers, and Consumers do reap the benefits of these policies, the level of documentation and support for independent developers (those ultimately responsible) is limited in the sense that they remain open to interruption, manipulation, or weak self-enforcement.

Black & White approach to internal investigations: An example we often see from a multitude of service provides (Google and Facebook most often), is when automated systems have been implemented as a cost-saving mechanism and fail to fairly flag questionable or inappropriate content. Often these tools leave no recourse for victims of a false positive. Often these systems are incomplete or partially automated, relying on human-in-the-loop intervention, often conducted by individuals who do not fully understand the content or context. Inverse to this, service providers often leave our critical safety mechanisms and protections for end-users, examples include, leaving out functionality for reporting or blocking dangerous end-users.

The rush to advance and roll out Artificial Intelligence systems without proper testing and safe guards: Very few service providers with AI service offerings put in the time & effort to properly test their AI or implement safe guards. In general, this is not uncommon behavior adopted by technology companies who want to  “move fast and break things”. However, the data required to operate these AI services is often personal information gathered from Customers (in the case of recommendations) or audio/visual data collected from public spaces (in the case of IoT devices) — Often without the proper consent and disclosure mechanisms in place, or the results of which are sometimes offensive or inconsiderate of the end-user (in the case of inherent racism or exclusionary practices).",,,,,,,

Like millions of Americans, I was impacted by the Equifax data breach in 2017. It was clear from the aftermath that once data is stolen in a breach, it can have a longstanding impact. Data stolen in one breach is used to compromise other systems, and the cycle continues much longer than any company likes to admit. This means that once peoples’ Personal Identifiable Information (PII) is accessed, it is available for bad actors to use for years to come. 
As consumers, we give away a wide range of PII to companies, including our movements, prayers, friends, menstrual cycles, web-browsing, and faces, among other fundamental aspects of our lives. These pieces of information that compose pieces of our identities are generally shared with certain parties for certain reasons. This is why when this data is exposed, it is not only a threat to the business but to the consumers’ human right to privacy and protection of their identity.
When a business carries PII, the highest risk is to the identifiable person in the event of a ransomware attack. It is estimated that a successful ransomware attack takes place  every 11 seconds in 2022. The businesses who collect the information have a responsibility to the people whose information they are taking to ensure they are taking steps to protect the data entrusted to them. PII that may be collected for security purposes or for account data must be protected in accordance with state, federal, and international laws and regulations that apply to their businesses. 

Remedies 

Often, organizations rely on data-in-rest encryption as their last line of defense. Unfortunately, if the file or information is being worked on, or is accessed using privileged credentials, this protection is rendered useless, and hackers can still steal the underlying data. We recommend U.S. businesses and government agencies consider data-in-use encryption instead, which keeps the data and IP encrypted and protected even when it is being actively utilized, neutralizing all possible data-related leverage and limiting the need for breach disclosure.

The historical ransomware protection toolbox comprising prevention and detection, backup and recovery, and encryption-at-rest is no longer sufficient. This excludes the data used when the file or information is being worked on or is accessed using privileged credentials – all protection in place is rendered useless, and hackers can still steal the underlying data prior to encrypting the systems. 

With encryption-in-use data protection, should adversaries break through perimeter security infrastructure and access measures, both structured and unstructured data will be undecipherable and unusable to bad actors. Both ransomware and extortion protection can be achieved through data-in-use encryption, as it provides unprecedented immunity against data-based attacks. This is an ideal way to protect regulated and consumer data.”

Questions re: ""To what extent do commercial surveillance practices or lax security measures harm consumers?"" Specifically, this comment addresses Section (a), Qs 4., 5., & 6. As an attorney who litigated the case of Beaven, et al v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, et al, 622 F.3d 540 (6th Cir. 2010), I can personally attest to the difficulty of proving harm to consumers (employees) in data privacy and security breach situations. On pages, 557-559 of the reported Beaven case, the 6th Circuit discusses the proof elements that the Plaintiffs brought into court, and rejected some elements (emotional distress and psychological harms), but did accept proof of ""actual damages"" under the Federal Privacy Act of 1974 based on employees' lost time having to take proactive steps to rectify and monitor their credit. The facts of Beaven involved a security/privacy breach of all employees' at the FMC Lexington federal prison site by the disclosure of the employees' personal identifying information including home addresses, home phone numbers, dates of birth, social security numbers, etc.  This disclosure of personal identifying information in the hands of inmates, many of whom know how to misuse and abuse such data against their prison-caretakers (or guards) was terrible.  It is perfectly understandable that the prison-caretakers needed to take proactive measures to obtain credit monitoring services (at their own cost), and spend time checking and re-checking that they were not victims of identity theft.  The 6th Circuit Court of Appeals permitted the Plaintiffs in Beaven to show their ""actual damage"" as that term is used in the Privacy Act, and permitted damages to be awarded based on credit monitoring costs incurred by some of the Plaintiffs as well as the value of time the employee-Plaintiffs spent to track and monitor their credit and safety of family members at their home addresses, etc.  Other harms such as emotional and psychological distress were not recognized as recoverable under the Privacy Act, but I can attest that such harms occurred. Many of the Plaintiffs had to invoke employee assistance personnel (EAP) offered through their employer (the Federal Bureau of Prisons) to help them deal with their emotional and psychological harms; a few of the Plaintiffs went to their psychological/psychiatric counselors for emotional/psychological injuries arising out of this privacy/security breach situation discussed in the Beaven case.
One final point, the ruling in the Beaven case permitting the award of ""actual damages"" under the Privacy Act, as above-described, was cited approvingly and relied in part on by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in the recent case of In re U.S. Office of Personnel Management Data Security Breach Litigation, 928 F.3d 42, 65-66 (D.C. Cir. 2019). The facts of harm to individuals in date security and privacy breaches is explored extensively in this D.C. Circuit case as well.  The facts of the 6th Circuit Beaven case and the OPM D.C. Circuit case should provide good fodder for the FTC to consider with respect to Qs 4.-6. of the Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.     ",,,,,,,

We believe that a major opportunity has been missed in both the wording of and discussions around the proposed Rules which are the subject of this Advanced Notice, and also the American Data Privacy and Protection Act (ADPPA).

In short, these proposed Rules and Act are inward-looking, considering the processing of personal data of US-based individuals only by organizations within the USA. Although significant data processing does occur in the US by US-HQed companies (Google, Meta et al), you would leave a significant gap in the protection of the privacy rights of US citizens, and your ability to enforce them in the medium-long term, by failing to impose the same rules on non-US organizations where processing US personal data. The initial effect of this is likely to be that difficulties may be experienced in US citizens gaining access to their rights where their data is sent outside the USA. The long-term effect is potentially that the US-based organizations which are undertaking that data processing may choose to move their operations outside the US, not only reducing US citizens’ access to enforce their privacy rights, but also reducing the US Treasury’s tax income.

As the current Bill and Rule proposals stand, they would not impact our ability as a non-US company to process the US personal data which we collect and hold, and the protections which are proposed within the US for US residents would not apply to us.

Changing this is simple, you need only add a section to the relevant law similar to Article 3 of GDPR, which brings both EU-based organizations (Article 3(1)) and non-EU-based organizations (Article 3(2)) into the scope of the rules and/or law.

To aid enforcement and access to rights, it would also be sensible to put in place a Representative obligation for non-US organizations, so that there is a US-based point of contact (and potentially liability) for non-US organizations. This is a concept which is likely familiar, from the existing agents for service out-of-state, which receive legal papers on behalf of their clients based elsewhere. This obligation is placed on non-EU organizations (including those in the USA) which process EU personal data as a result of GDPR Article 27.

The short answer is yes, there should be security rules in place as part of a larger Federal privacy and security legislation. Current regulations (HIPAA for example) are prescriptive around what must be done to keep an individuals information private, but there is no real guidance around how to keep it secure. Security exists to make sure we meet Privacy requirements. 

There are many prescriptive controls that can be added into any rule that should not be burdensome to any company. Controls around data access, logging, monitoring, encryption, and many others. Within these controls it should be possible to be rather granular without creating too much impediment to any company in trying to implement them. Many things could be considered baseline controls, or simply doing the right thing. 

A big part of keeping information secure is being able to identify what information is where. Both within a companies infrastructure, and to any third parties that company uses to provide whatever services they're supposed to be providing. Companies should be compelled to provide information about their security, and the security of their third parties to the general public. There are ways to do that without disclosing any vulnerabilities or proprietary information. Privacy policies and security documents should be displayed in a prominent position (not just some small link at the bottom of a page) so that anyone can read them. And they should be posted in either easily understood language, or with notes explaining what everything means so that people who are not privacy or security professionals can read and understand. 

Companies should work much harder to instill trust with their clients. Rules, legislation, regulation, laws... all of that... can be used effectively to help ensure this is happening across the board. ",,,,,,,

While surveillance technologies and big data algorithmic applications have been touted as making communities and potentially even society safer, evidence has shown that these systems not only exacerbate extant social inequalities but also create new problems and threat surfaces, in areas such as healthcare (Williams, R. M., 2018, 2021b; Obermeyer, et al., 2019; Brown, et al., 2020; Ymous, et al., 2020), education (Gebhart, 2017; Swauger, 2020a, 2020b; Kelley & Oliver, 2020; Brown, 2020; Grant-Chapman, Venzke, & Quay-de la Vallee, 2020; Brown & Laird, 2021; Venzke, 2021), job hiring and assessment practices (Bertrand & Mullainathan, 2004; Chachra, 2016; Caliskan, Bryson, Narayanan, 2017; Terrell, et al., 2017; Chen, et al., 2018; Williams, D., 2021); the carceral legal system (Angwin, Larson et al., 2016a, 2016b, 2016c; Benjamin, 2019; Williams, D., 2020), and many more (Williams, D., 2022 [http://hdl.handle.net/10919/111528]).

The proposed regulatory structure provides the opportunity to ensure that companies are held meaningfully accountable in the all-too-likely even that they fail to account for the harms that their systems will do, and that increased meaningful accountability will in turn hopefully push said companies to think about these structures beforehand, rather than post hoc, when something has gone wrong.

Considering question set (d.), as regards the shape and precise extents of the regulations applied to the offending corporations: meaningfully prohibitive fines in the event of a breach of civil or privacy rights; required submission to proactive assessment of both the construction and proposed field of application of technologies for data collection and storage and surveillance; said assessment to be carried out by teams of people knowledgeable in the most recent research into the implications and effects of these technologies— knowledgeable via either academic learning, lived experiential expertise, or, preferably, both. This last would ensure that those most likely to be marginalized and negatively impacted by these technologies have a say in how they are created and administered.

Again: Those most likely to be made subject to these technologies, and especially those who have experience of their negative impacts should have a major say in the approval, administration, and regulation of said technologies, at every level. Ensuring that both the FTC's search and the arrangement of the proposed rule explicitly provide for meaningful inclusion of the most marginalized is fundamental to constructing a framework in which technological tools and systems can be designed, created, and deployed in a less harmful, less oppressive way.

This data is kept forever, with no easy mechanism to have it deleted from everywhere at once, and is opt-out per service rather than requiring opt-in by default. This data affects job opportunities, housing availability, opens the door for targeted harassment, and empowers the state in ways Soviet Russia only wished it had available at the time. 

Bring back the right to privacy in America. Make commercial surveillance opt-in only, make using a service without agreeing to data collection a mandatory option, and impose massive fines (25% of global revenue) for any collection or sharing of data without explicit consent by consumers.",,,,,,,

That we consider that personal data goes beyond privacy. Privacy is the baseline. If data is the fuel of the Digital Economy, then each individual’s personal data is an asset that has value and copyrights. Individuals should have the right to very easily download all their Google and other digital platforms data into their own personal data store. Consumers should be represented by fiduciaries who protect, enhance and promote their best legal data interests. Each individual’s data can be stored and updated in a personal data vault. It should be analyzed via on-device AI. The insights from that data should first and foremost, serve the individual with insights that make their life productive and provides decision support. In addition, if the individual so chooses, guided by their fiduciary, they can license to ethical brands, for fair value as determined by the marketplace, actionable insights. We believe this is a future where privacy is protected and we generate trillions of dollars in economic value for individuals as well as ethical businesses. This is how we achieve privacy AND personalized health care, finance and lifestyle consumption. This is a win win scenario. You must pass the legislation that enables that bright future where we optimize, mit compromise, our digital future. Thank you. ",,,,,,,

The SDPC is a community of vendors, schools, state and federal agencies representing over 10,000 districts across the U.S., Australia and New Zealand focused on addressing student data privacy operational issues. The SDPC has been very successful in standardizing data privacy agreements (DPAs), including the National Data Privacy Agreement (NDPA) used across the country, and is now focused on addressing security controls used by vendors to meet legal privacy obligations.

The lack of a standard set of security controls to protect education data is a serious concern across the PK20 ecosystem. To address this the SDPC is leveraging the work of the Australian government and other established security standards to create a Global Education Security Standard (GESS) that can be adopted by all PK20 vendors. This will standardize the cyber security controls expected to be in place whenever a vendor holds student data. Vendors could then be audited against this common set of control benchmarks and eventually certified as meeting the requirements. 

This brief comment is intended to inform the FTC of work around security expectations to protect sensitive data. Please feel free to use this non-profit Community as a resource for your work.

The American Disabilities Act protecting Americans is being ignored in the Trade Regulation Rule on Commercial Surveillance and Data Security.  Silicon Valley has lawfully and unlawfully collected enough data on American consumers to create technology used to “group” consumers. These groups are for marketing and lead generation and are sold for millions to companies. 

The technology innovators work closely with Psychologists to develop marketing strategies. Psychologists are trained to know and understand the behavior of individuals with cognitive impairments and/or intellectual disabilities. 

Companies exploit this group with an array of dark patterns because they are money-makers. As a person with ADHD, I fall victim to this technology often. organizations such as Google, Adobe, GoDaddy have Psychologists on staff for marketing enhancement. Psychologists also know the commonalities, behaviors, and vulnerabilities of ADHD-diagnosed individuals. As an adult with ADHD, dark patterns have cost me countless hours and thousands of dollars. It is widely known that ADHD consumers: do the following:
•	Impulsive purchasing
•	Lose and reset multiple passwords
•	Easily are distracted by long and tedious keystroke practices
•	Have multiple emails
•	Not remembering to cancel a trial
•	Not recognizing a subscription enrollment
•	Have multiple charges for the same SaaS service and with realizing they are being charged for the same service.  Adobe uses different names on bank statements to disable technology from finding these duplicate payments.  
•	Negative-option contractual agreements


The unethical psychologists on staff at Adobe and other big tech giants, who build software associated with the use of dark patterns on the vulnerable, should lose their licenses. They took an oath to help people, instead, they sold and exploited the behaviors of those who suffer from cognitive impairments. 

It is my hope that lawmakers get more involved with Silicon Valley and what is happening right under their noses.

And this system does not keep us safer. Instead it is a byproduct of allowing advertising interests to bypass every norm and legal protection for our personal data. Businesses and shady ""data brokers"" enrich themselves by selling our information to each other and to any law enforcement entity willing to pay for an end-run around legal protections against illegal search and seizure. 

We cannot prevent this collection and sale, we do not profit from it, we can't correct errors in our data. Indeed, we can't even inspect it. 

This system must go. We need real privacy protection in the US that acknowledges the harms inherent in a lawless commercial surveillance economy and punishes severely those who would continue to operate it. People should own their own information. We can't afford to let go of the legal protections afforded to us already by allowing commercial interests to exploit the technical advantages they have to collect personal information. 

My personal information has been breached at least 8 times because of lax security on websites. And yet they are not required to be audited by third-party security experts. Each breach is characterized as a who-knew-it-could-happen accident, even though the company failed to put basic protections in place, such as encrypting data at rest with a strong encryption protocol or removing sensitive data from the internet. These websites have barely been slapped on the wrist, while our information circulates as a constant identity theft and fraud hazard. 

Even Equifax lost the information of 147 million people whom it was charged to protect. That breach was so egregious that in a just world Equifax would no longer exist. And yet none of us can opt out of the credit bureaus, we can't easily correct information there, and even if we did, we would only be throwing good information after bad before their next breach. Practically any person at any business that offers credit can access this information, regardless of the flimsy rules, because it's so easy to gain access to. 

Cookie opt-outs are a ludicrous reminder that inadequate regulation punishes only the individual, who often has no idea of what's at stake and yet has to do extra work to choose among incomprehensible options. 

Not meeting GDPR has cost many businesses a lot of money, as EU data had to be moved out of the US because of our lax standards of consumer protection for personal data. Amazon and WhatsApp have been fined 746 and 225 million euros each under GDPR, but this is far from a painful deterrent for them, and it does not repair the harms done. Close the circle between fines and harms. Magnitude matters. 

It's time to enact real privacy protections in the United States. We should be leading the world in protecting people online, but instead the US can't even meet the low GDPR standard. Much more is needed than the GDPR provides in terms of international enforcement. Lack of privacy has real harms to real people on a daily basis. Please act to stop commercial and criminal exploitation of us all by making lax data practices and perverse economic incentives a thing of the past. ",,,,,,,

Targeted advertising is the heart of American commerce, and if you take away the data, you also take away the ability a businesses ability to tailor its message.
This will lead to more noise in the advertising space, since there will be less relevancy, and will further increase the cost of advertising.
The real casualty of more legislation around this will be small businesses and mid-market companies -- not big tech.

Further, GDPR is not worth emulating.
By the numbers, the EU is not thriving economically, and businesses are terrified of any approach that utilizes third-party data -- for fear of fines and lawsuits.
GDPR limits tailored advertising, it limits creative uses of A.I. and technical innovation, and it makes it nearly impossible for businesses to catch up to those already on top.

The only way to protect privacy is for consumers to take privacy into their own hands, as individuals, and be educated on how to properly shield their identities from advertisers -- if that's what they want to do.

Support the American economy and American interest by leaving this up to the states themselves, or better yet, find a way to further disincentivize legislative efforts like CCPA and GDPR from becoming widespread here in America.",,,,,,,

I start by admitting from the top, that while I work in tech, I am not an expert in Commercial Surveillance or Data Security. I will not be able to speak deeply on nuances of policy or share insight on the engineering of specific systems. I am glad that the esteemed panelists have done that. I also defer to the profound and impactful work of community organizations that have been doing this work for years and I ask all of you to listen and seek advice from groups like ACRE, The Electronic Frontiers Front, Athena Coalition, Lucy Parsons Lab, Carceral Tech Resistance Network, MacArthur Justice, Interrupting Criminalization, and the countless others I have missed. 

Where I can speak is as a concerned citizen sharing from the heart of a community. As a Portlander and carceral abolitionist, I speak from my context. We have countless years of brutality, both direct from the brutal baton of officers, and indirect from the countless invasions of our homes and rights by law enforcement and the myriad companies enabling further countless harms. While I hesitate to make Portland an exception to prove the rule, I do find our experience a useful lesson. In 2012, the US DOJ filed suit against the Portland Police Bureau due to a pattern and practice of brutality against those experiencing a mental health crisis, some of them murdered. Our police have also been found to rely on racial profiling, to have known members  of extremist groups (one is currently employed as a supporter of the insurrectionist Oath Keepers after the police refused to discipline), and too many community members have been shot, killed, and harmed with too little accountability. In 2020 Federal police came in unmarked uniforms and gassed us, flew drones, piloted surveillance planes over our homes, and left thousands bruised, sick, and fearful while the FPS, ICE, and DHS refuse to apologize, or admit fault. 

To return to the topic at hand, surveillance and data privacy… our community asks for change before we expand tools and access to law enforcement that has not taken accountability for it’s past. We know these departments surveil citizens. We know these departments watch us illegally. We see the expansion of their tools to attack our neighbors but we do not see accountability, reparations, or truth-telling. I ask us to step back and start from a place of community care and that asks why we should give more tools to organizations that have shown a commitment to harm. Rather, can we fund transformative systems seeking to address root causes? I know of one small soup kitchen that needs some simple kitchen repairs. I know of a small houseless focused newspaper that could use some boosting. It's not flashy, Peter Thiel won’t like it but these small things could truly change things and make the need to mass surveil us, unnecessary. Let's look to expand those projects, truly building communities. 
I hope to end with a quote from the great Ella Baker, “Those of us who are not ready for the burning will go down to our city halls, go down to our mayors and to our governors and even to our federal government and question why so much artillery (I will add, mass surveillance tech) is being bought and stacked and stopped to deal with people who are fighting against an oppressive or a repressive system that they have become victim to. The voice of those who believe that life is more sacred than property must be heard now, if at no other time.” 

Thank you.

I had signed up to be among those speaking during the hearing this afternoon (9/8/22) but have a schedule conflict.
Here's what I was going to bring to light about the data 'security' of FTC and commercial surveillance. 
1) The word 'surveillance' is a clue to increased data mining, not less. The federal control of data on its citizens in America is already too much. This federal collection is also under international data sharing standards and must meet United Nations/EU/Transatlantic and many other agreements where untold amounts of private information on We the People is sharing and used against us.
2) The collusion by the FTC with corrupt education entities is also something which falls under 'commercial' use of data. High stakes tests (assessments), especially. These sets of data are being used to profit off of students (all ages/school choices), especially under the guise of Covid relief and mental health.
Profiteers in the data mining fields are using the data to manipulate school boards, curriculum, social services and more. This is totally unconstitutional.
20 US Code 1232a strictly prohibits the government in ANY form, funding, service, etc. to influence education, yet, data collection/tracking does precisely that.
FTC is working with private groups like the Brookings Institute, Disney, Zuckerburg, Amazon, the UN Foundation, Goldman Sachs. and the US Mission to the UN in other federal agencies. Why? None of these entities are qualified to partner with the nation when each one of them is guilty of misuse of private information. Again, all these must kowtow to international data groups bent on using data to undermine our freedoms.
3) The FTC is also part of what I have phrased as the ""Common Core Machine"" in education. This was solidified under USMCA, Child Development Block Grants, HHS funding (especially ""Oscar Care""). How? Streamlining data algorithms, increasing biometrics, and more. The justification? To 'help' citizens.
No, it's to control them.
Finally, my almost 20 years of education research could point out even more egregiousness by our government and data uses, but I will leave it to these main 3 points. The FTC has no right to allow these activities to go on. ",,,,,,,

My name is Bo Kohut and I have been perusing, using, and abusing what we have all come to know as the interest since I first logged on in 1991. My interest drove me to get a computer programming degree in the mid 1990s which many mocked then. Since then I have founded, architected, managed, and exited multiple technology startups all within the highly regulated financial payments industry. I have also been privy to assist in technology matters for multiple States of our Union as well as having written software for the United States Government.

Given my direct vast experience in this arena throughout the full spectrum I am fully supportive of this FTC pursuit. The data exchange issue has become one of profit over all else, including but not limited to personal security and risk to life, as directly seen very recently with the internet's shunting of KiwiFarms(1) after a U.S. Senators experience. However this is a double edged sword that will likely have exceptions and thus loopholes which are certain to be exploited as some present here know with the given recent disclosure of Fog Reveal(2) which was ‘secretly in use’ by the very Government attempting to pursue these goals. Another very recent event that some may not be aware of is a transcription service as an app called Otter.ai which has been discovered to be listening and transcribing even after deselecting its ability to do so. Clearly snooping and spying has extreme value just ask Apple from their great invention called the “AirTag”. The world is becoming familiar with one country's response known as GDPR however here we are abusing our citizens' privacy through technology of which very few understand how any of it works as even Meta engineers, formerly Facebook, recently admitted as such under oath from a recently unsealed court hearing involving the Cambridge Analytical hearing(3). Our allies over the pond have also created legislation about how hardware devices must be built with security in mind, however all hardware is software if you didn't know so here we are again imposing how something must be done correctly, writing software.(4)

No matter what comes of such legal pursuits, let alone enforcement of something directly related to the confidential intellectual property of a business, this in no way will be fixing everyone's existing data issues that are alive today. I have read through several of the Regulations public comments and many want it fixed but I regret to inform everyone alive today that your data is out there and cannot be taken back or removed. That cat is out of the bag and just as the cat will not go back in said bag neither will everyone's data just disappear as it is already released. This problem will only be solved over time, likely decades, after enforcement begins and businesses' change to offering something of value worth paying for versus the ‘freemium model’ that is powered by selling the very thing we are meeting about here for today. Never ever forget, what you cannot see matters most!

For those in despair hearing nothing but talk I offer some hope of action touching on Rebecca Finlays mention from earlier as there are people working on just such solutions to this problem which involves various techniques such as homomorphic encryption and application obscured data storage models. The only way to prevent someone from selling something is to ensure they do not have that very thing they want to sell. Unfortunately, just as in Cyber security, this is not something that is just purchased as an off the shelf solution but will require entire data to systems to be rearchitected from the foundation up. This will cost substantial capital and in doing so will highly likely reduce revenue as well so existing businesses’ today will not be doing this willingly and thus the opportunity to build something new that is designed with security first.

Grateful to be able to participate and I welcome any further discussion.

Anti-Trust overlaps a bit with data security.  The centralization of data (considering it's growing value) paints targets on the backs of enormous companies which, if they're like Meta or Amazon, are responsible for multiple data collecting apps of devices the average American might use.  Each of these offers would-be assailants enormous windows into our personal lives, and the size of these leaks in modern history is getting to be beyond absurd.  

We are vulnerable on a global scale, and as of yet, only Europe and California seem to actually be taking the risk to people seriously.  This is data that can be so intimate you may not share it even with close friends and family, and yet in so many cases, this data can be bought cheap and quickly de-anonymized and even weaponized.  But even in the case that it isn't used in a particularly malicious fashion, it's still being collected and monetized without our full understanding or consent.

Even measures like those Apple has taken have been both effective in increasing informed consent and lowering opt-in rates as well.  But for those who do still choose to willingly and knowingly trade their data for services, that data must be protected.  It's an increasingly valuable target, and can quickly be made personally dangerous in the wrong hands.

Enforcing data protection compliance for companies that collect and store our data is important, but so it my ability to ask them to delete my data and have them actually do it.  My data must always be connected to my active consent, and should I choose to revoke that consent, I should have the right to rest assured that my data has been removed, and I am safe from concern for that companies usage of it and willingness to secure it.

The modern surveillance economy is a real nightmare, and not only for the reasons stated above, but it may be possible to reign it in with aggressive legislation and enforcement.  Without that, I fear the modern surveillance economy is a crucial piece of a dystopian future that we're approaching.",,,,,,,

This same person facilitated but failed, to record my voice to then obtain said access via this recording.

Subsequently, this same person spread lies about me to criminal organizations and gangs in an effort to harass, intimidate, and stalk me realtime using data collected from my Android cell phone.

This monitoring of me by various criminal organizations still continues to this day and is blatantly obvious, given my phone calls have been obviously tapped by gang bangers on multiple occasions.

I want to bring attention to recent academic research that has uncovered serious privacy issues with voice information collected by voice assistants and smart speakers. The convenience of voice input has contributed to the rising popularity of smart speakers, but it has also introduced several unique biometric privacy threats. Recent academic research [1] has shown that smart speakers use voice data (directly or indirectly) to infer user interests and uses it to serve behaviorally targeted ads. This is despite them making deceptive public promises that they do not use this information “to target ads”.  

Voice assistants conjure notions of devices that serve consumers personally. But the reality is that they are far from personal in that they are controlled by, and share data with, the voice assistant manufacturers and other parties they interact with. Thus, the commission should strongly consider biometric information collected, processed, and shared by smart speakers and voice assistants in its rulemaking efforts.

As third-party cookies and mobile device identifiers are being phased out, academic research shows that companies are resorting to new techniques for cross-site and cross-device tracking. I want to bring attention to two specific practices:

1.	First-party tracking cookies: Recent privacy research has shown that many companies are starting to use “first-party cookies” for cross-site tracking when third-party cookies are blocked. A recent academic study showed that more than 90% of top-10K websites employ first-party tracking cookies. 

2.	Browser fingerprinting: Recent privacy research has shown that companies are increasingly employing highly invasive browser fingerprinting techniques for cross-site tracking. A recent academic study showed that browser fingerprinting is now used on over a quarter of the top-10K websites by known cross-site tracking companies.

In summary, academic research clearly shows that many companies are actively attempting to thwart privacy protections against cross-site and cross-device tracking. This has led to a technical arms race between trackers and privacy-enhancing browsers/devices. The commission should pay special attention to such circumvention attempts in its rule making efforts because they seriously undermine consumer privacy efforts in the short- and long-term.

In its COPPA guidance from almost a decade ago, the FTC expanded the definition of personal information to include persistent device identifiers that include, but are not limited to, a customer number held in a cookie, an Internet Protocol (IP) address, a processor or device serial number, or unique device identifier. 
I would encourage the commission to uphold this COPPA guidance. 

I would additionally encourage the commission to expand the definition to personal information to pseudonymous identifiers that are typically obtained by hashing other persistent identifiers. Ample academic research [1], including by former FTC Chief Technologist [2], has shown that “hashed pseudonymous identifiers” almost always fail, and thus should be classified as personal information.

Online companies have been collecting a great deal of private information from users. Even if there is an opportunity to opt out from supplying some of this data, it is very difficult to ascertain that and few users understand what to do. Consumer data is not just used to support advertising. It is sold to third parties and in turn to aggregators who are compiling full dossiers on Americans. There is no way to know that these exist or see them and no mechanism to correct errors in the information. These are in turn available to various law enforcement agencies giving the government a free hand in surveilling people without requiring a warrant. There are of course many other risks to consumers since everything from insurance purchases to employment opportunities can be impacted by the purchase of consumer data from third parties and aggregators. People can be excluded from insurance or face higher rates without any opportunity to even understand the basis of these decisions.

It is necessary to demand that companies stop collecting any data that is not required for them to conduct their business with consumers. If they desire additional data that should be on the basis of an opt-in mechanism and it should be spelled out clearly to the consumer exactly where there data is going and if this changes, the consumer should be notified and have an opportunity to rescind their agreement before any change is enacted.

In states like CA where there is already a data privacy law, no regulation by the FTC should enable companies to follow lower  standards established than those compelled by the state law.  State law was enacted with the consent of the citizens of that state and was designed to protect the right to privacy and due process. 

There must be a civil right of action by a consumer whose data is mishandled according to any new FTC regulation. There should be a fine for non-compliance that is proportional to the revenue of the company involved because otherwise large companies will see violations as merely a cost of doing business and will continue to avoid compliance. Even with a right of action, it is usually prohibitively expensive for the average consumer to take legal action against a company. There must be a simple mechanism in place, perhaps involving submission of a complaint by a consumer to their state AG and a requirement for a timely investigation of the complaint. Third party data brokers and aggregators must also be regulated because by now they already have massive amounts of consumer data. So, that data must be removed or at the least the person whose data has been collected must be informed and be allowed to demand that the data is deleted from any database.

I would not be at all surprised to learn that companies are selling our data to foreign countries who are willing to pay for it. There should be an investigation by the FTC to determine the extent to which this is occurring and an immediate effort to halt any such practices.

I am also concerned about the use of algorithms to make decisions on everything from employment and loan applications to sentencing and parole decisions. Most recently California hospitals who are using an algorithm developed by researchers at Stanford University to predict the likelihood of patient deterioration and are using it to advise patients and their families on whether to continue pursuing medical care. I am very concerned about the implementation of algorithms without any kind of controlled study to assess whether they are at all accurate. I believe that the FTC must regulate these because people's lives are being profoundly influenced by data that they have no opportunity to see, understand or rebut.

Thank you very much for your attention to these very pressing concerns.

Julie Bernstein, Ph.D.

The Problem of Data Breaches

According to HaveIBeenPwned.com – a website that allows users to check whether their email address or phone number appears in a data breach – my email address has been found in 7 hacked databases, including some from third-party data brokers with names I’ve never heard of, like Apollo (https://www.wired.com/story/apollo-breach-linkedin-salesforce-data/) and Exactis (https://www.wired.com/story/exactis-database-leak-340-million-records/). The Exactis breach compromised reams of sensitive personal data, including my credit status information, date of birth, education level, and much more. I don’t want this information to be up for sale, especially to companies that I don’t know.

It is exhausting trying to keep up with username and password combinations for the hundreds of websites I interface with online. But I do that work of maintaining countless unique passwords because that’s the only method I have (short of not using online services at all, which is becoming increasingly difficult) of protecting myself and my data online. 

Companies must know by now that data breaches happen routinely. Given that even the largest, most sophisticated companies have demonstrated that they can’t prevent breaches, I believe companies should manage the risk of data exposure by limiting the amount of data they keep on each user. That way, subsequent data breaches will reveal less data and cause less harm.

The Trouble with Opting Out

FTC rulemaking should provide guidance about data governance for companies that collect data in places where it’s impossible to get consent from people.

I read a Bloomberg article (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-14/how-street-parking-became-a-magnet-for-tech-startups?cmpid=BBD091422_CITYLAB&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_term=220914&utm_campaign=citylabdaily) this morning about a spate of tech companies trying to change the way cities manage street parking. Apparently one startup Automotus mounts cameras on street poles to “collect data on curb parking activity,” with the aim of helping cities “set policy.” While Automotus says it blurs faces, how can I be sure of this? If my city were to work with Automotus, I would have no choice but to submit to this surveillance, where a private company creates data points out of my comings and goings, with no way to opt out.   

Along a similar vein, reporting from an article in Fast Company (https://www.fastcompany.com/90788367/the-mtas-switch-to-omny-machines-is-a-privacy-nightmare) suggests that NYC MTA’s  switch from MetroCard to One Metro New York, or OMNY, threatens to create an “inescapable tracking regime” by tying rider information to real names and active credit cards. OMNY data is apparently more granular than MetroCard data was, and it appears OMNY is highly willing to share this data with law enforcement (NYPD and ICE). Again, there is no way to opt out if you’d like to continue using the subway system.  

Conclusion

I understand the allure of big data. It promises companies greater access to insights that can help them produce better products so they can compete against other companies. However, the harms of data breaches are serious and frequent enough that the government should put restrictions around the amount of data companies can capture, retain, and sell to other entities. 

Thank you for your time and consideration.

To this end, I provide the following observations and suggestions.

1. As someone who has used the internet job boards at different times to search for potential change of employment, I have noticed that when I choose to hide my contact details and publish my resume anonymously, somehow I begin receiving direct emails with job offers that are not passed through an anonymous relay provided by the job site.

a.  It is my belief that this happens because there exist some unknown shadow job databases that are harvesting and storing the contact and work history of job-seekers.  Since, in the past, I have not always published my information anonymously, my contact details were collected in those past instances.  Even though my old job-seeker profiles were deleted and re-created as anonymous profiles, upon publishing the new anonymous profile, I believe my resume was matched to the stored version in the shadow database that contained contact information.  This observation is somewhat speculative in nature, but based on repeated observations that I’ve made over a number of years.  There is some reason that publishing an anonymous resume is no longer anonymous and so I’ve attempted to provide a hypothesis for that.  Another possibility is that the particular job site which I’ve most associated with this issue may have an ongoing, years-long software “bug” that doesn’t actually provide the anonymity to a jobseeker that they claim to provide, which would also be a serious concern.

b.  FTC should ban the harvesting of resumes or impose strict limits on the practice.  At a minimum, there should be a short time limit in which companies are allowed to maintain copies of harvested resumes.  Better still would be to require that the consumer grant explicit permission for their resume to be collected by a third-party company that has no reasonable expectation of directly offering employment to that job seeker.  When a job seeker deletes their resume, they should have confidence that it is really deleted from any database that directly or indirectly copied the resume.

c.  FTC should ensure that job search platforms provide the anonymity that they claim to provide to the user and that they don’t reveal information to prospective employers that they’re not supposed to reveal, according to what they tell their job-seeking users.

2. As someone who has used the internet to send and receive payments for various transactions, I am bothered to know that some sites that require bank account numbers and routing numbers do not support 2-factor authentication, even as an option.

a.  I would like to see FTC mandate that any website that stores bank account numbers must at least provide the user with an option to use 2-factor authentication and present that option in an obvious way.

Thank you for taking the time to consider these comments.  I hope they help contribute to a more complete discussion of the kinds of privacy issues consumers are noticing in the online world.",,,,,,,

Every layer, from the operating system (Windows, Android) to the browser (Chrome), to the websites (Amazon, Facebook) collects every bit of data it can get its hands on. The consumer no longer uses the product, the consumer _is_ the product. Setting limits on data collection doesn't have to reduce the effectiveness of ads, however. Basic usage data can be collected and processed on the user's machine to place them into general groups, thus creating personalized advertising without transmission if in-depth personal and interaction data.

a.1: Tracking across websites, with smartphones and other smart devices, and many more.

a.4: These practices harm consumers in many ways, from making it easier to steal identities to using information for extortion and everything in-between. The effects can be negligible through catastrophic. There is no way to categorize the possible harms.

a.5: Yes, including the use of information to hack brains, whether to increase engagement/addiction to targeted advertising. People are not going to notice this because it is a subtle reprogramming. This can also be used for manufactured consent and other political purposes. 

a.7: I am not smart enough to answer this question.

a.8: All of the harms in my answer to Question a.5.

a.9: Not quite, but the Commission is improving.

a.10: It should be agnostic because data can be stored forever, and the uses for that data cannot be envisioned until it happens.

a.11: Any business model where the users are not the customers (like advertising) has these problems. If users are customers, there is a business relationship which can provide the users with compensation should something go wrong, but when users are not customers, there is no way to get compensation.

a.12: They should be addressed in an egalitarian way, as put forth in the Civil Right Act of 1964 because anything that will harm anyone has the potential to harm minorities, women, victims, etc. The more harms are pursued and punished, the less harm will come to all kinds of consumers.

b.13: My answer to Question a.5 has good examples of how these practices can harm children, including teenagers. Brain hacking is especially bad for children and teenagers because their brains are not fully developed, and they do not have as many defenses against brain hacking. Even worse, such brain hacking can lead to permanent changes because their brains are still developing.

b.14: The right to be forgotten is a good one and should be sweeping for children, teenagers, and adults.

b.15: This is always an unfair practice, but I'm not sure companies should be completely responsible for it. Companies should be required to meet a reasonable standard of care, but after that, it's a problem for parents.

b.16: I'm not sure.

b.17: Yes. This is a perfect example of brain hacking, and they are always unfair practices because they cannot be defended against.

b.18: There should be no distinguishing between ages because these practices are unfair even against adults.

b.19: Parental consent should be part of the reasonable standard of care required of companies, but it should not be considered sufficient. The most important other protection is to require companies to only gather as much data as is necessary.

b.20: The market is big, and it should be shut down. Trade regulations should blanket ban this practice because of the potential harm to children and teenagers.

b.21: Yes. Yes, and it should be banned because such brain hacking can permanently change developing brains.

b.22: No. The regulations should be blanket bans on anything that companies do not need.

b.23: Requiring such techniques would be a privacy nightmare and such requirements should not be implemented. It would lead to companies taking over user devices. Google has already terminated accounts even when the account holder has been cleared by relevant law enforcement. This is a bad idea.

c.24: The cost can be catastrophic, and the benefits to consumers comparatively negligible.

c.26: Restrictions would enhance innovation because it would force many companies to adapt or die. This might actually lead to useful innovations instead of brain hacking.

c.27: Restrictions would enhance competition because companies that don't gather data will not have a disadvantage since companies that do will have to spend more.

c.28: It will be important to remember that brain hacking on children may have permanent effects, which can be silently catastrophic. This should be taken into consideration.

c.29: The benefits are negligible compared to the costs. The costs are that brain hacking will only get worse as companies monopolize and rent-seek. There is no limit to the costs.

d.I.30: Self-regulation is not sufficient; the incentives are wrong.

d.III.42: It is not cost-effective vs contextual advertising.

d.IV.53: It is everywhere and inevitable. The benefits are scale for a company, but the costs are catastrophic for individuals and society. Algorithmic decision-making should not be allowed.

d.IV.55: Yes, and yes.

d.IV.56: Algorithmic decision-making should always be overridable with human decision-making.

d.IV.57: They do not benefit.

d.IV.60: Algorithmic decision-making should be banned if possible.

d.IV.63: Personalized advertisements are not speech.

d.VI.73: Consumer consent is not effective.",,,,,,,

To Whom It May Concern:
	The undersigned organizations request that the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) extend the deadline for filing comments on the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for Trade Regulation Rule on Commercial Surveillance and Data Security (“ANPR”) that was published in the Federal Register on August 22, 2022.  The ANPR seeks to develop a record to establish a rule that would fundamentally alter the modern economy.  As such, the FTC should base the development of a proposed rule on the highest quality and most complete record possible.  Specifically, we request a 60-day extension of the comment deadline from October 21, 2022 to December 20, 2022. 
	Additional time would permit the undersigned organizations to understand and evaluate more thoroughly the voluminous number of questions and considerations put forth by the FTC.  The ANPR seeks information, research, and experiential data about almost all aspects of the modern data-driven economy, and it does so through a procedure the FTC has rarely used for such an expansive and vaguely defined purpose.  More time is required for all stakeholders, including the undersigned organizations, to provide the detailed comments and information that the FTC is requesting, including comments on the various economic impacts of a potential regulation, the multiple alternatives available to the FTC, and the significant (and potentially negative) downstream impacts of sweeping regulations on commercial data practices for consumers, businesses, and the American economy.

Commissioner Alvaro Bedoya
RE: NPRM Public Comment & Input for Trade Regulation Rules on Commercial Surveillance & Data Security

Alvaro,

This is a letter of public comment towards the instances of commercialized public-private mass surveillance.
 
It behooves this effort to convene on what the US government pays information systems, ISPs or data brokers for mass surveillance, criminal surveillance, for cleaning and reorganizing commercial data pulled from social media companies and online aggregators who rely on artificial intelligence tools to collect, classify and organize conformable practice in the marketplace, with or without a warrant. 
The context is important as it is very clear, given case studies with Cambridge Analytica, that companies, like Facebook, are government service contractors who license “looks” at their online consumer base for a price point. Their contracts have been with The FBI, the US State Department, the DOD and any number of the ODNI agency trees who shook out personal data during the PRISM-NSA debacle. 

These companies, and others in this ecosystem, have sold or licensed personal information about American citizens as dataveillance to India, Russia, Iran and the People’s Republic of China. While one contractor violates the personal rights of the US citizen as a service to the US government, the exact same contractor sells information to our enemies about our citizens, our business infrastructure and our way of life under the loose classification of “advertising”, which amounts to laundering information sales in the due course of business.
 
Downwind data brokers are also contractors and subcontractors in this extended ecosystem. These are cottage industries, often extra-nationalized brokerages. The most common example would be the data cleaner and data architects, Indian nationals, who log in to from remote cloud workspaces, sometimes in India: sometimes in San Jose, sometimes in Redmond, Washington, sometimes in Jacksonville, FL sometimes in Langley, VA etc. etc. depending on where the company has them.  Since COVID, it is where they remote work for themselves as themselves. Data security gaps are granted to these “small businesses”, or individuals as LLCs, working hourly contracts to clean and coordinate scalable data in spreadsheets for license or marketing globally to be used for sale or as a monetary exchange items, with or without ANY consent from the person whom is being used as an article of currency.


The FTC needs to share regulator duties and powers of enforcement directly with the consumer. What that means is they need to coordinate self-ownership and property rights with the SEC and with the FCC. The Securities Exchange Commission has the regulatory authority to manage claims of monopoly and of price fixing. The US consumer currently has no control over the pricing and transactional brokerage of their data. They have not appointed any one federally controlled brokerage to manage the price and regulatory issuance of price controls over FED formulas at it applies to data and the conversion of it into a monetary valuation.  Data brokerages make money on the data property by cloning and reproducing it in order to make additional money from transactional duplicities.

  
Emerging regulations really need to scale down to the smallest processors and data controllers based on systems reorganization of personal data classification in a more principled lifecycle and really extend accountable measures to anyone who has access to personal data.  If a company suddenly becomes beholden to the consumer directly, whom having a digital-FDIC-virtual broker approved for the due course of business with larger scaled ecosystems, who now is currently operating 10 legal miles above their “submit” button exchanges, they will be able to know when their data is being approved for a sale exchange, to whom and for what price.
  
From there they can adjust the rates and approve any further data convention for license OR reject all of it, having none of it go to market.  To present obdurate, or to gaslight and say we cannot observe what is plainly happening and happening to the US taxpayer, when their government licenses a profile on their doings as surveillance is not simply an insult, it’s a price fixing scam merged with a corporatist human rights violation, sanctioned by our own government or a rival government.
Thank you for observing these comments while seeking useful regulatory information for your purposes at the FTC.

Please reach out if you have any follow questions or requests more specific guidance on these points.

Sincerely, 

Sheila M. Dean, 
US data owner and privacy classification advocate

But it is important to note that these trade-offs do not affect all individuals equally. In fact, surveillance and data collection have disproportionately affected communities of color under both past and current circumstances and political regimes.

Facial recognition and other surveillance technologies like remote neural monitoring also enable more precise discrimination, especially as law enforcement agencies continue to make misinformed, predictive decisions around arrest and detainment that disproportionately impact marginalized populations.

Artificial intelligence is intentionally being used for racial profiling by applying next-generation technology to watch its people, potentially ushering in a new era of automated racism in an effort to make African Americans more subservient.

Collecting genetic material is a key part of this new surveillance.  This sharing of data violates scientific norms of informed consent.   No one should be in a database without express consent.  The comprehensive DNA database is being used to surveil using random citizen watch groups in the neighborhood, creating a divide and conquer mentality.  We will grow to not trust our neighbors.  The technology and its use to keep tabs on innocent people.  I am one of many people caught up in a vast campaign of surveillance and oppression.

I would like to provide my personal experience, please, as way of a comment on ANPR no. R111004. My comment addresses in particular ANPR question #3, on the prevalence of commercial surveillance practices; #15, on failures to provide children and teenagers with privacy protections, such as not providing privacy-protective settings by default, an unfair practice, even if the site or service is not targeted to minors; and question #38, on the need for rules limiting the commercial surveillance practices that use or facilitate the use of facial recognition, fingerprinting, or other biometric technologies.  I have kept my comment brief, so as to forego the need for an executive summary.
My family and I recently attempted to go on a cruise vacation with a national carrier.  I’m intentionally not naming the company, as I am not seeing for the FTC to file an enforcement action at this time.  I believe my dealings with the company on this case illustrate the great urgency for regulations to protect the American consumer, specifically the need to change industry practice from that of “opting out” of commercial surveillance to consumers having to “opt in” for companies to utilize their personal data.
I am one who reads the “fine print,” and I believed I understood the particulars of sailing with this company.  I was then confused why there was not an option to opt out during online check-in of the requirement to upload a photo.  I noted on the cruise line’s Privacy Policy that its section on facial recognition technology was prefaced by the bolded word “Optional” (excerpt from the policy attached as supporting material).
Of particular concern to me was the type and quality of the photo being demanded by the cruise line.  I attempted to upload an intentionally granular photo or one in which I was in a more casual pose, so that it could be used for identification and not artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced algorithms.  However, the website wouldn’t accept any due to reasons such as “Bad pose detected,” “Too far away”, or “Blurry.”  This made it clear that what they were seeking was a biometric photograph for use in facial recognition matching.
I proceeded to call the cruise line multiple times to resolve the issue.  Management refused to speak with me themselves.  An agent relayed to me that opting out “was not an option” and I would be required to submit a photo, either via upload before or through the cruise line taking a picture at the dock.  Purportedly, the photo was needed to “verify I am who I say I am.”  I responded my passport, which was already required, was sufficient to accomplish this - logic which the agent agreed with.  I asked her to speak to management again, for my family’s privacy was of paramount concern and the cruise line was already collecting vast amounts of personal data, which I was not comfortable to link to a biometric.  The agent told me the use of photographs was the prevailing standard of all cruise lines.  I told her that the risk of harm to my adolescent children and to my young teen was unacceptable, as they have their whole lives ahead of them and much of the data being collected is permanent.  She spoke to management again and was told I would be denied boarding at the port if I did not submit to my and my family’s photographs being taken.  Faced with this certainty, we were forced to cancel our reservation and request a full refund (case still pending with cruise line).
My experience with the cruise line industry shows that requiring companies to produce more public facing documents will not protect consumers.  For, if the documents that are out there currently are a lie, what will requiring more accomplish?  In my case, the cruise line’s Terms and Conditions clearly articulated under the “Personal Data and Privacy” section that facial recognition technology use would be as-described within their Privacy Policy – which specified it was “Optional.”  This did not make a difference, though.  The only effective solution to ensuring consumer privacy, then, is to create a rule that requires “opting in” to being commercially surveilled.  This will protect consumers while still allow companies to financially benefit off of those who wish to sell their face and other personal family data.
In summary, I believe it imperative that the FTC implement new trade regulations concerning how companies collect, use, analyze, retain, and monetize consumer data.  I have presented my personal experience with one segment of the economy to help the Commission understand the egregiously deceptive ways adults and minors alike are being taken advantage of, and even how those who educate themselves are being unfairly harmed by the prevailing business models of the industry.  I tried to be an informed consumer, but I was still at a disadvantage that left me with more than $5,000 of cancellation fees.

Harms to Children?
In response to the FTC’s question “Are there practices or measures to which children or teenagers are particularly vulnerable or susceptible?”

DataEthics4All Foundation's Response: A resounding Yes!! Social Media algorithms, AdTech policies and EdTech Apps are the 3 most prevalent practices that are damaging to the privacy of children and teenagers.

Reasons are:

1. Kids today are born with a digital footprint.
2. Even toys often offer complimentary apps, so child’s play has inclusively become a target for transformation into valuable or even profitable data, a process called ""datafication"".
3. We’re falling behind. Just like we were taught not to talk to strangers, today’s kids need to be taught how to protect their data and privacy.
4. Studies have found that even older children lack the knowledge of what personal data is, how it flows and why their data may be valuable to someone else. Their main concern is the information available to their parents online instead of strangers.
5. There is a lack of understanding that the platforms we use today also collect their information and use it for their own purposes.
6. Lacking a clear understanding of the risks, children are significantly more vulnerable than adults online. Some children even consider the online space more private because it is parent-free.
7. Breaches in data privacy can also put children at risk of information and identity theft, stalking, or even discrimination. 
8. Information found online follows us, so the data gathered about children today could affect their future chances in areas like education or employment.


DataEthics4All Foundation's proposed Solutions:

1. CCPA and CPRA equivalent uniform law across all the 50 states of the United States of America.
2. No Personally Identifiable Data PII must be allowed to be collected on anyone under 18.
3. The only exception to that rule must be if that data directly helps the child like improving their scores. 
4. This data if and when collected must be only with parent’s explicit consent, not a blanket consent from the School district for all things digital.
5. This data collection must have clear sunset policies either if it’s no longer helping the student and for the academic year.
6. In no circumstances PII data collected must be allowed to be brokered or sold. Period.
7. Laws should be made where no personalized ads can be shown to children under 18 as they can be heavily influenced without the presence of their parents or guardians.
8. Social Media Algorithms must be designed with a time limit auto lock to cap the amount of time kids spend on social media rather than designing the algorithms for unlimited hooks.
9. And lastly, there should be a law where any data collected on a US Citizen must stay within our borders.

This proposed rule is a START, but does not go nearly far enough to adequately protect privacy. 1. The U.S. needs a comprehensive rule similar to the E.U.'s GDPR, and we needed it 10 years ago. 2. The FTC should not be regulating data privacy and whether and how commercial entities can collect, store, sell, and use individuals' data. Starting from a posture of this being a commercial activity proves that the U.S. Government has missed the point. Individuals do not have the power to retrieve this information once it has been collected. They are virtually powerless to keep track of which entity has collected their data, let alone to whom it has been sold. Very few companies are making any efforts to scrub outdated data, resulting in breaches and other incidents (see the Illuminate Education breach). Pass this rule. And then get started on a better, more comprehensive one that actually protects the American people. ",,,,,,,

Here are some specific actions I urge the FTC to take:nn- Commercial surveillance technologies: As surveillance devices flood the market, we've seen the installation of the largest private surveillance network in US history. Doorbell cameras, floodlight cameras, AI powered dash cameras, automated license plate readers, facial recognition and other tools of biometric surveillance give corporations roaming eyes in every neighborhood, shopping center, and street in our communities. It's become nearly impossible to avoid being surveilled in daily life. The unprecedented amounts of data swept up en masse by private surveillance networks give corporations the information necessary to feed development of new products and adopt manipulative marketing techniques without any respect for privacy or even the illusion that people could opt in or out of the system. This surveillance has led to the most intimate details of our lives being monetized and our daily whereabouts tracked. Once companies have gathered this private, sensitive data, it becomes subject to misuse in ways users could never have anticipated. In response to the onslaught of surveillance technologies, the FTC must ban the use, sale, and dissemination of facial recognition technology, and institute human rights-based protections that give people full autonomy and control over their personal information and digital bodies, including image, voice, and whereabouts.nn- Data minimization: We must dispose of the false premise that “accept all'' policies are in any way a sign of meaningful or informed consent. Companies draft privacy language that the majority of the public are unable to read and understand. Meanwhile, the data collected by a company doesn't always stay with that entity, as companies profit off the sharing of individuals' data with third-party data brokers. Not only do many people not realize this is a common practice, but it is also unlikely they could understand the potential impacts or how this data could be used as it changes hands. As this data is collected and merged, companies are able to predict personal behavior and infer ones' identity, despite industry claims of anonymity. The aggregation of this data allows private entities to conduct discriminatory prediction, which results in biased practices and policies that negatively impact marginalized and vulnerable communities. To address issues with data collection, the FTC should prohibit any private entity from collecting and processing data unless users meaningfully opt-in, case by case.nn- Data security: After a private entity has collected consumer data, the onus must be on that company to take meaningful steps to ensure the security of that data. Endless examples of cyberattacks that have exposed peoples' personal, biometric, financial, and other data highlight how the information companies collect is a target for hackers, data thieves, and other bad actors. In order to fully protect consumer data, the FTC must require all internet enabled consumer products to employ end-to-end encryption by default. The FTC should also require companies to regularly perform data privacy, civil rights impact audits to ensure accountability for data security and transparency around breaches and company practices. nnThe FTC must use its full authority to not only address issues that are prevalent at present, but to proactively protect users in the future as technology and commercial surveillance practices evolve.

Data collection is enabled by fraudulent contracts claiming the right to property created by the user of a service (the data from the activities of the user) as ""forfeit"" for the users' use of the service. Not ""exchange"", FORFEIT. They get to seize that property without any reckoning to the owner. The only actual valid transaction they should be able to enact would be payment via bartering the data created by the user for the use of the service. nnThat makes users de facto CUSTOMERS of the service, with all the rights of the same. And the forcing of the exchange of data as the only method of payment accepted - well, do federal and state governments consider property as currency at all, or allow massive-scale barter transactions to go untaxed? Because if it doesn't, then those services should also be offering the option of actual currency as payment for the service instead of *any data collection whatsoever*, and all tax laws apply yo. nnAnother huge point which nobody, especially government, seems to address. The advertising industry possesses the means to offer advertising choices based on explicit wishes from consumers, meaning all ads are completely relevant to the CURRENT purchasing needs of the viewer. If I want to buy mayo today and I enter the word ""mayo"" in a list saved in my browser, the advertising industry has the technology, in PATENTED form (see many patents about serving ads based on personally-entered lists stored in customer browsers), to serve me ads for mayo where ever I go online. Which means I will likely click those ads and very possibly purchase from one of them, yielding an extremely successful conversion rate for the advertiser in selling the seller's product, and minimizing their advertising costs for the sale.nnBut selling products is not what the advertising industry considers its job to be. They think their job is to gouge every dime of sellers' advertising budget. And so, they have ignored and suppressed this technology and these patents in favor of unrestricted data collection and ad-spamming, AND TOLD THEIR CUSTOMERS IT'S THE BEST WAY! Just look at their marketing materials to their customers!nnIs that not blatantly fraudulent behavior on the part of advertisers? Knowingly ignoring and suppressing a much more effective - and cost effective - way of providing services, in order to price gouge the living hell out of their customers' budgets? I think it is, and the whole corrupt industry needs to be sued, forced to return massive amounts of fraudulently-obtained revenues to sellers, and forced to offer the advertising model laid out in those patents instead. nnIn conclusion, I fully support the FTC in exercising the full extent of its authority to address the entire life cycle of data—collection, use, management, retention, and deletion—in order to provide people and customers of advertising services with significant protection from fraud. The FTC must use its full authority to not only address issues that are prevalent at present, but to proactively protect users and buyers of advertising services in the future as technology and commercial surveillance practices evolve.

According to the 13th amendment to the United States Constitution, “Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude … shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.”  (constitution.congress.gov › amendment-13)

According to the Federal Trade Commission, commercial surveillance is “the collection, aggregation, analysis, retention, transfer, or monetization of consumer data and the direct derivatives of that information.” (www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/08/22/2022-17752/trade-regulation-rule-on-commercial-surveillance-and-data-security)

I note three key elements in recognizing the commercialization of Internet surveillance as involuntary servitude: capture, control and profit. 

Capture: As of 2022, the United States had over 307 million internet users. (www.statista.com/statistics/325645/usa-number-of-internet-users/) 

There is no free lunch, yet we all enjoy the benefits of free information search, free maps, free apps on our phones, free browsers on our PCs, etc. All these free services can be mined both directly and indirectly for information about the user.
The offer of free services in exchange for surreptitious surveillance is coercion.  

The State Department lists seven examples of modern slavery.  (www.state.gov/what-is-modern-slavery/)  The page mentions coercion multiple times as a means of creating/enforcing slavery; traditional chains and shackles are not mentioned at all. 

If you read the Federal Register trade-regulation-rule-on-commercial-surveillance-and-data-security document on a free web browser, you’ve been captured, and perhaps surveilled.

Control: If I generate value, and someone else controls the collection, distribution, pricing, and sale of the value I generate without my participation in the process, I am in a position of involuntary servitude. I do not, and cannot, know the value of my information to anyone buying it – someone else controls my information, which is my property. The person generating value is controlled by exclusion.  

Profit:  If companies could not profit from it, there would be no rationale for commercializing Internet surveillance.  If our information is valuable, why not offer us a fair price for it?  Without knowing the value of our information, we cannot set a reasonable price should we decide to voluntarily sell it.
Plantation slavery was a successful and profitable business model, yet we abolished it.  If a company cannot survive without slavery, it has the wrong business model.

Basic proposal: Involuntary commercial Internet surveillance must be illegal, it is involuntary servitude.  

Opt-out must be the defacto norm.  Brokering of information beyond the control and approval of the customers generating that information must not be allowed. 

I find nothing in the FTC's questions to suggest that individuals should not become merchants of their own information.  Internet users generate value and should be allowed to benefit directly from that value if they wish. Guidelines for voluntary information disclosure must be crafted with clear and verifiable rules for collecting, processing, verifying, storing and deleting information.   

Technology can be employed to recognize, block and report surreptitious commercial tracking, as well as channel legitimate information transfer. 

The 'free' trinkets we enjoy cannot cost so much that the largest tech companies operate at a loss – the opposite is obvious. Since there are so many players already collecting, aggregating and reselling, there must be established methods for evaluating our information.  

Why aren't we invited (incentivized) to participate in surveillance capitalism, if we want, on our own terms?  Market forces will forge new business models to meet new situations, as they always have. 

There is a precedent. By 1870, sharecroppers, small farmers, and plantation owners in the American south had produced more cotton than they had in 1860, and by 1880, they exported more cotton than they had in 1860. The loss of slave labor led to increased commercial activity. (www.mshistorynow.mdah.ms.gov/issue/cotton-and-the-civil-war)

The FTC’s question 95 invites comment on the potential obsolescence of any rulemaking. The abolition of slavery should not be subject to 'potential obsolescence', it should be the guiding principle when regulating commercialized Internet surveillance. 

If a ruling on the 13th amendment is beyond the FTC’s remit, I respectfully request that you open a dialog with your colleagues at State and Justice.  Please see also the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Articles 4 and 12. (www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/2021/03/udhr.pdf)

The FTC acknowledges that most Americans today surrender their personal information in almost every aspect of their lives. Companies have developed systems to collect and capitalize on this data. Consumers often provide ""informed consent"" in the form of lengthy privacy notices that are typically clicked by. Under Section 18 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. § 57(a)), the FTC is authorized to prescribe ""rules which define with specificity acts or practices which are unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce."" Developments in public research suggest that trade regulation rules may need to be made more stringent to protect Americans from unfair or deceptive acts or practices.

Commercial surveillance and data security often comes into play in conversations about social media. With social media being a modern development, privacy issues in this context are unprecedented. Once of the main features of social media is the sites’ ability to use consumer data based on search history, activity on other sites, etc. to personalize the users' experience and in turn, maximize profit. This feature has had incremental effects on social media users, specifically young people. In the past few years, many people note shrinking attention spans and diagnoses of ADHD are higher than ever. Social media algorithms feed negatively into people’s ability to focus, difficulty controlling impulses, and even anxiety and sleep habits.

On the other side, however, social media algorithms provide a platform for extremely effective marketing. Not only has social media created entire careers that did not exist before the past few years (namely influencing), but the ability to directly target consumers through access to private data has made for niche advertisement in a way that was never possible before. This is beneficial to both the marketer and the consumer in some ways. These modern platforms are unprecedented and abiding by the original privacy provisions laid out by the founders in the Constitution may not allow for an effective market in today's world.

Both of these aspects should be taken into account when considering tightening data security regulations.",,,,,,,

As a digital professional who leaded digital products implementation for international private organizations and public administrations, I can testify the children's digital experience is not, at the present time, sufficiently protected. This issue is rather a protracted one, giving its complex, dual nature englobing cultural/societal perspectives and technological capabilities. Technologic age determination is a subject at the same time critical to this topic, but also representative for the complex issues surrounding it. At this stage, after reviewing a number of methods tested for age determination, the main issues raised by them reflect at least one of the following issues: reliability (eg self-declaration) and privacy and security (eg photo id transfer, automated activity reviews...). A third issue that concerns developers is the aggregated digital experience friction that the deployment of such systems is bound to introduce once deployed at the scale of the entire internet.

Nevertheless, the need to better protect children in an environment in which, sometimes, porn content (free access) is more easily accessible than societal information (paywalled or account protected) is obvious. Some jurisdictions have already moved to take steps and correct such imbalances, but more needs to be done. And to this respect, we are not use the full extent that present technological capabilities offer us or properly exploit even already implemented technological features. Below I develop an answer to the quastion raised around hree main notions, that can be viewed separately or as part of an entire all can shape the latter affirmation:

2/ app/platform age rating

There are different ways by which this is happening: (1) Data is being collected on consumer shopping behavior, from the decision to purchase the item, to where this item is being purchased from and for how much. (2) Financial data is being tracked. An example of that are the loans consumers apply for and are eligible for and eventually receive. (3) Movement data is being tracked through the ownership of a smart phone and all the different location permissions granted to applications such as google maps, apple maps, and so on. (4) Online presence and activities are being tracked through which social media platforms a consumer is a part of, and which posts are grabbing their attention, among others. 
The harm inflicted by these kinds of surveillance and tracking takes on many forms. It is important to give credit to the benefit a consumer receives from some types of surveillance, through personalized products (i.e., deals on products a consumer looks at frequently) and content (i.e., based on their location and what is happening around them) . However, the harm is substantial. 
First, there is embedded algorithmic bias in the existing systems. This is because the data used is historical data and the algorithm has no way of identifying historical inequalities. This would affect automatic responses to loan applications for example. Second, there is higher risk of identity theft. When all this data is being collected about a consumer without protections, and most industries falling victim to cyberattacks, fraud is more prominent. Third, there is algorithmic reinforcement which can be described as consumer engagement with specific content. When a consumer engages with a post and the information provided in that post is biased, they risk being bombarded with the same kind of information from different sources. A good and recent example of that would be the misinformation and conspiracy theories that were created during the pandemic. 
I have four main recommendations related to potential regulations in this area:
1.	Every consumer should have the right to be forgotten. In the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) gives the consumer the power to request their data be deleted and specifies a timeline by which an organization must comply or be penalized. In the US, this practice does not exist on a federal or state level.
2.	Consumers should have the right to data ownership. It should be at the discretion of the consumer whether they would want to share or refuse to share data without their decision impacting their use of specific platforms. For example, some websites do not allow you to browse their inventory without providing an e-mail address or mobile phone number or consenting to invasive cookies.
3.	Consumers must provide express consent to having their online activity tracked. For example, Meta and TikTok have advertising profiles on people that have not even used their platforms and applications. 
4.	Consumer consent should be limited to the company requiring consent and should not allow companies to sell data to third parties.  This should be applicable regardless of the category the data belongs to.

If they collected this data themselves, the courts would require them to obtains search warrants, but by buying the data from data brokers they can obtain the data without court approval. Furthermore, although such data is ""anonymized"", taken together it provides enough detail that individuals can be identified, such as where they live, where they work, what they buy, where they bank, where they travel, what web sites they visit, what social media forums they participate in, when they visit such sites, how long they spend there, what groups they belong to, what they ""like"" or ""dislike"", etc.

Americans would never allow such a ""Big Brother"" system to be put in place openly, but there seems to be a real danger of it being secretly implemented without public awareness or proper approval by Congress (which would probably never happen since it would violate the Fourth Amendment's ban on warrantless searches).",,,,,,,

The public needs to be protected from the discrimination, potential persecution, and related harms that result from reckless data practices.  I fully support the FTC exercising the full extent of its authority to address data collection, use, and management.   The harms caused by widespread, unregulated corporate surveillance and  the unfair and deceptive mass collection, use, and sharing of peoples’ data pose a direct threat to the public at large. These harms can disproportionately affect marginalized groups by replicating and amplifying inequities stemming from systemic and historic discrimination. In our post-Roe world, these threats have become more significant for people who can get pregnant. 

 Here are some specific actions I urge the FTC to take:

- Commercial surveillance technologies: 
Doorbell cameras, AI powered dash cameras, automated license plate readers, facial recognition and other tools of biometric surveillance give corporations roaming eyes in every community. It’s become nearly impossible to avoid being surveilled in daily life. The unprecedented amounts of data swept up by private surveillance networks  has led to the most intimate details of our lives being monetized and our daily whereabouts tracked. Once companies have gathered this private, sensitive data, it becomes subject to misuse in ways users could never have anticipated. In response to the onslaught of surveillance technologies, the FTC must ban the use, sale, and dissemination of facial recognition technology, and institute human rights-based protections that give people full autonomy and control over their personal information and digital bodies, including image, voice, and location.

- Data minimization:  
Companies draft privacy language that the majority of the public are unable to read and understand. Meanwhile, the data collected by a company doesn’t always stay with that entity, as companies profit off the sharing of individuals’ data with third-party data brokers. Not only do many people not realize this is a common practice, but it is also unlikely they could understand the potential impacts or how this data could be used as it changes hands. As this data is collected and merged, companies are able to predict personal behavior and infer ones' identity, despite industry claims of anonymity. The aggregation of this data allows private entities to conduct discriminatory prediction, which results in biased practices and policies that negatively impact marginalized and vulnerable communities. The FTC should impose strict data minimization obligations on companies and ensure that individuals retain maximal control over their own personal data.

- Data security: 
The onus of ensuring the security of personal data must be borne by the private entity collecting that data. Cyber attacks that have exposed peoples’ personal, biometric, financial, and other data highlight how the information companies collect is a target for hackers and criminals. The FTC must require all internet enabled consumer products to employ end-to-end encryption by default. The FTC should also require companies to regularly perform data privacy, civil rights impact audits.

The FTC must use its full authority to not only address these current issues , but to proactively protect future consumers as technology and commercial surveillance evolves. I thank the FTC for launching this rule making process and support its efforts to address the harms of surveillance and data abuses.",,,,,,,

There needs to be some kind of sensible default which affords individuals the ability to restrict access to their data, but also allows companies to use these data (which are only valuable for insight on a population-level) for network effects, machine learning, and so on. There are technical advances like federated learning, or privacy-preserving ML that many companies could draw on, but the broader issue in my view is the conceptualization of privacy needs to be updated for the modern era, wherein key concepts like the Fourth Amendment could be reimagined for a digital landscape, one which is not place- or presence-based. We need a digital bill of rights which treats the internet and associated provinces as entirely separate from the physical world, and hopefully rules like this move us in that direction.

The past year and a half I have been experiencing forced thought conversations, being mindfully connected to what I perceive to be artifical representations of actual people. I've learned that some ai is using a representation of my presence in mindful interactions with people that I was completely unaware of until I found out in actual conversation which resulted in me being incredibly harsh and insensitive to my loved ones. I have no ability to disconnect from these forced mindful interactions that are invading my every day life without my consent. I feel a switch in my conscious all throughout the day that I perceive as being switched between multiple entities of which I have no idea who I am being switched too. I feel as if I may be unwittingly helping unknown,  (unknown to me), tech companies develop their ""tools"" without ever having been presented with a form of consent. The result: I fear being in public, fear applying for work or of the unknown factors of what, who, and how much a person's presence will be within my mind and body while I'm working,  fear of having my own train of thought, no ability to determine how much of my own personal privacy within my own mind and body that I actually have anymore, I'm subject to an unknown entity showing up within the results of the artwork that I create as well as ruining my ability to naturally create art by way of being present without my consent throughout the process in which I'm creating my art. I wake up multiple times throughout the night and there is always a presence already within me, all day long I am with these unknown entities that are essentially along the ride with me throughout my daily activities even though I explicitly state mindfully as well as vocally that I do not want anyone or anything to be present within my mind and body. I still to this day experience the presence of certain individuals that I have explicitly stated do not have consent to be present within my mind or body, I have lost all ability to feel secure within my own mind and body. I've experienced artifical emotions within my body where i was being controlled into crying and laughing hysterically at the same time. I have experienced body language not my own coming out in my personality, my voice changes tone and accent and i have no idea who or what entity the presence belongs too. I have experienced months under the control of what I believe is the result of some augmented reality journey builder, example: when all of these things began I was manipulated by way of these journeys in believing I was the prophet of God, they did so by way of using the presence of my dead father who communicated this to me as well as control over my body that felt like God was directing my head towards the direction of heaven. They used a representation of the members of the public presence in highly offensive ways to further engage me into this ""experience"", such as assigning roles to people I walked past or that I became acquainted with, roles that fit this narrative such as the anti-christ and apostles,  as well as artifical emotions, artifical personalities that show up in my body language and other mindful imagery and mindful engagements that further led me to think this was all pre-revelations. I am completely ignorant of how i could go about WHO this augmented reality journey builder belongs too. I propose the implementation of a user interface that allows a person to find out who has access to their mind and body and in what ways they have access, including time frames they have access with the ability to opt out or refuse access to them. My mind and my body feels violated by not having access to the information that informs me of who these unknown entities are that I feel are a constant part of my life now.  ",,,,,,,

Organizations with smaller budgets need the ability to target their users specifically and avoid spending money to share their products with consumers who have no interest in them.

This is primarily how this data is being used when it comes to advertising - it is not being used for algorithmic discrimination.

Recent privacy changes at Facebook have already had a significant negative impact and any additional changes will make starting a new business online only accessible to the rich who can afford the budget needed to run untargeted advertising.

Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, and Meta are massive threats to huge swathes of the population, as well as to the industrial integrity and national security of the country.

Break 'em up.

I'm a startup founder, a veteran software engineer with over 10 years of experience at firms that have attempted to compete with Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, and Meta, and they represent a huge drain to productivity, competition, and innovation in the United States.

Break them up.

Jedi Blue? Safari as the only browser engine on iOS? The duopolistic App Store and Google Play Store? Consolidation of social media in Zuck's exploitative little empire? Massive collusion going back to Steve Jobs' personal efforts to suppress wages? Employees routinely pooping in bags to power Dr. Evil's retail deliveries, while Number 2 ratchets up profitability of AWS and hoodwinks the government into intense, moronic vendor lock-in?

Break these Tech Tyrants up. Splinter them into a dozen pieces, just like Rockefeller's oil company and Ma Bell. Do more than fill them with fear, like Microsoft. Yes, they were reigned in: they're of marginal competitive threat to anyone except certain classes of developer tool developers.

Please have some integrity and stand up for your country. The value of each firm will increase, too. Consolidation is recipe for stagnation.

Why has the FTC been asleep for the past couple decades? Stop shirking your responsibility.

Wake up. Break them up.

Roopa Pandit, Indiana

I think so. Biometrics are highly sensitive information and personally identifiable information as well. I think instead there should be intermediary markers that serve as indicators for a person that protect their anonymity, such as a serial number or an alphabetical code. This harmonizes the need to identify individuals by creating placeholder identifiers without utilizing identifiers that encroach on their biologically private data. This is especially pertinent because people who use biological data are usually trying to secure something critical with that information, and don't want it exposed to nefarious commercialized sources.",,,,,,,

We design and produce websites, logos, printed materials, and digital ad campaigns for clients around the country. 

I have never submitted a comment to the FTC before, but I'm really concerned that the Commission might change the digital economy rules in ways that will hurt my business and my clients' businesses.

Many of our clients are small, local businesses eager to promote their brands and find more customers online. They succeed due to hard work and e-marketing strategies, including affordable personalized digital advertising that helps them connect to potential customers. If the Commission changes important rules - including limiting how online platforms and ad-tech services collect, process, and utilize data - I'm concerned it will undermine advertising and marketing effectiveness, costing small businesses money and customers.

I appreciate the Commission's concerns about data misuse and privacy, but millions of small businesses count on affordable digital marketing and advertising tools being effective. I implore the Commission to refrain from changing the rules in ways that will hinder small business growth and success.

I am a self-employed Massage therapist.  I rent space in two locations and market myself by having a digital presence in Google.  On my Business page in Google it provides very valuable information to potential customers about me and how to contact and find me.  I count on this technology being kept as it is, because I want people to be able to find me, read and learn about me and my business, call or message and ask questions, and ultimately book and appointment.  

I depend on Google and how they collect and manage my data.  If this where to change, I would loose business and go back a couple of generations in marketing... word of mouth.  It works, but I can not survive on such slow growth.  I need the modern tools of today to keep me and my family fed.

Please allow Google to continue doing what they are good at doing. Keeping everyone informed with the latest data.

Thank you for the opportunity to share a comment on this important issue.  I'd like to offer ours from the perspective of a small-business owner here in North Carolina.

I own a second-generation family business here in Kitty Hawk, NC, that rents vacation homes to people visiting the Outer Banks. I’m submitting this comment because the Federal Trade Commission must understand how data-powered personalized advertising drives so much of our success and why any changes to the current rules could negatively impact our small business.

Our family has been in the vacation home management business for decades. I like to say that we were Airbnb before Airbnb existed. 

Today, people book vacations on our website. Our marketing efforts involve online advertising and social media to engage with potential customers. This business is challenging and very competitive, and the pandemic was rough. But thanks to affordable digital marketing and our great team, we find new customers all over the country who want to visit the Outer Banks on vacation, and we deliver a great experience.

The FTC Notice suggests that personalized digital advertising offends people and violates their privacy, but this is false. We don’t know the identities of people who click on our ads unless they independently submit their data. Our ads are personalized because they use information that the person knowingly shares, for example, visiting Outer Banks websites and likely interested in vacation rental homes. Data-powered ads are vital to our ability to attract customers, and regulating these activities could really hurt us.

I strongly urge the Commission to avoid changing personalized or targeted digital advertising in ways that will make our marketing more difficult, more expensive, or both. 



Sincerely,

Clark Twiddy
President, Twiddy & Company

 I am dismayed that chasing the almighty dollar has become the agreed-upon highest value of interaction between seller and buyer, to the point that the buyer's private information can be appropriated,  basically stolen,  merely by the corporation announcing it decided it gets to have and USE that information AS A CONSEQUENCE of the customer buying its purported 'goods/services.' It is deceptive and arrogant.  It means the customer is actually serving the corporation, has become a widget.   No wonder people have lost trust and confidence in these mega-corporations with their arrogant CEOs and legal departments, who cavalierly sell off our private info for profit.  It must be stopped. 

I think the FCC must stop allowing this to go on.  It results in a homogenization of provider, service, customer, customer's private information and data security -- such that the customer is used just as the office furniture or the logo'd boxes.  Corporations have become themselves merely players in games of 
power and obscene largesse, while people in our society go hungry and without medical care or education.  It increases selfishness and drives a wedge between people, a result of the  self-serving 'Corporations Are People' ruling. No wonder people are depressed, focused on short-term entertainments, and turning upon each other.  EVERYthing is becoming 'corporate'.  Our world needs a less jaded and abused population to stop the wreckage corporations are leaving in their wake.  We need better rules and better enforcement of them.

Indeed, Google and Facebook have made billions of dollars from stealing our personal data and then using it to track and target us across the internet. We’ve already had a glimpse of the terrifying consequences of tech companies spying on us, with law enforcement using Google’s data trove to track women visiting abortion clinics. The US government, via the FTC, needs to provide far greater privacy protections to its citizens and consumers and strictly limit the ways these Big Tech giants can access our data.

With this in mind, some specific actions I urge the FTC to take include (but are by no means limited to):

--Crack down on commercial surveillance, including banning the use, sale and dissemination of facial recognition technology and give users full control over their personal information like image, voice and location.
--Enforce the principle of data minimization. Companies use underhand techniques to collect data and then share it with third parties, as well as using it to predict personal behavior and inferring identity. The FTC must impose strict data minimization rules to stop these abusive data practices.
--Protect consumer data. The FTC must require all internet enabled consumer products to employ end-to-end encryption by default. The FTC should also require companies to regularly perform data privacy, civil rights impact audits.

Thank you very much for your time and attention.

My privacy online is very important to me.  I want to make my own choices about which ads to see if I want to see any at all, not third parties.  Additionally, facial recognition is not ready for prime time in my opinion.  It does not give users full control over their personal information like image, voice and location and therefore should not be used.
The FTC must impose strict data minimization rules to stop these abusive data practices.
The FTC must require all internet enabled consumer products to employ end-to-end encryption by default. The FTC should also require companies to regularly perform data privacy, civil rights impact audits.  
In short users should have more protection regarding their privacy on line.

The Google Business listing, maps as well as their personalized ads tool makes a big difference in my business. Without these tools, it is likely that I would struggle to maintain the level of business we currently enjoy. I employ a number of employees who are not High School graduates and who are ex-gang members. Without these jobs, these people will probably be on some sort govt assistance. Please consider all the good that Google does with the tools they offer small business before making any changes. 

Thank you

Then our ""Friends & Family"" would comment how cute the baby is and how cool is that new car. Then Facebook started ""updating"" their software as they also 'softened' the users.

Now, your politics activate algorithms. Now, your personal beliefs get you banned from platforms.

It's not that the consumer no longer cares, it's the ""fine-print"" of living in this modern world that make us 'sign' on that dotted line without reading what they really want from us.

For more than 25 years, the World Wide Web has been redefining our cultural experience to the point where honestly few of us can think of living without online interaction.  However, I feel that this area has not been regulated well, even as it has become one of the most critical areas of our culture.

At the beginning of the Internet Revolution, there was a feeling among the Silicon Valley startups that not only were they creating a world-changing technology, but that they were going to reimagine the way humans lived.  Their inventions would make life better, freer, more happy for humanity.  Paired with this feeling was an inground fear that 'big government' would swoop in and ruin everything with needless regulations and limits. Thus, an innate strain of crypto-libertarian philosophy was hard-baked into the systems via the worldview of their creators.  All speech is good, any form of censorship is bad, the less regulation on Internet companies the better.  The Internet is inherently a force for good, and needs no oversight. Time has shown these to all be fallacies.

As the Internet matured and grew, and as companies like Alphabet and Meta began to dominate the social media spaces, a troubling pattern that America has seen before began to appear.  I personally refer to it as Gilded Age 2.0.  Companies that were lauded as bringers of freedom and wealth are beginning to consolidate into monopolies and quash or co-opt their rivals.  Revenue has become their driving force, and these goliath Silicone Valley conglomerates have begun to defend their corporate fiefdoms aggressively. They also seek to maximize their revenue stream by any means necessary, heedless of the real-world consequences.

This is not to say that these companies do not have beneficial products.  Looking back to the original Gilded Age, Standard Oil, the railroads, the coal mining industry, and the various Industrial Age industries were initially praised for elevating humanity with cheap energy/transport/goods.  It was only later as they became bloated monopolies that they stifled competition and innovation while fixing prices and keeping wages low.   We find ourselves in this situation today with Internet industries.

What is even more troubling is the rise of these companies as the arbiters of what information we see.  Through algorithms that seek to keep us online and engaged as much as possible, the various social media platforms and services like YouTube feed us misinformation and extremist content.  The political turmoil of the past decade has been turbocharged by this, in countries like Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Brazil, and even in Britain and America.  Fringe extremist views and commentators are promoted via algorithms to millions of social media viewers, for the simple reason that people will stay on longer and see more ads when watching this sort of content.

It is long past time that a robust regulatory framework is put in place to put some guardrails on these companies.  The Federal Trade Commission was created in part to rein in the excesses of the original Gilded Age Robber Barons.  It is time for it to remember its mission and go after the Robber Barons of Gilded Age 2.0.",,,,,,,

•	Enforce the principle of data minimization. Companies use underhand techniques to collect data and then share it with third parties, as well as using it to predict personal behavior and inferring identity. The FTC must impose strict data minimization rules to stop these abusive data practices.
•	Protect consumer data. The FTC must require all internet enabled consumer products to employ end-to-end encryption by default. The FTC should also require companies to regularly perform data privacy, civil rights impact audits.

SOME form of regulation that will induce accountability is needed for the tech companies who have been able to monitor and track individuals and groups who use their specific platforms. Big tech has not impetus to change their behaviors voluntarily and while I am not a person who believes in over-regulation, I do believe that unless the FTC steps in, this situation will never improve. In fact, it will only cause further deterioration in the ongoing divisiveness that has steadily eroded trust in the government or other public entities. We no longer have the ""Wild West"" and unless the FTC explicitly has some form of regulation in place, it will further push this country into a state of anarchy, ultimately resulting in an autocracy an NO personal freedoms.   

Thank you.

The issue at stake here is the vast quantity of personal data, obliterating any real sense of individual privacy, that the tech industry routinely steals without our knowledge, despite its claims to providing notice in its lengthy and largely unreadable privacy policies.  Were we to read each and every ""privacy policy"" statement, we would never get up from our computers or look up from our smartphones or pads.  The use of that data by facebook, google, etc. is frequently pushing disinformation into people's heads and causing physical violence against others, harming many of us, particularly to the most vulnerable members of society like people of color, members of the LGBTQ community and kids. 

Here are some specific actions I urge the FTC to take:

    Crack down on commercial surveillance, including banning the use, sale and dissemination of facial recognition technology and give users full control over their personal information like image, voice and location.
    Enforce the principle of data minimization. Companies use underhanded techniques to collect data and then share it with third parties, as well as using it to predict personal behavior and inferring identity. The FTC must impose strict data minimization rules to stop these abusive data practices.
    Protect consumer data. The FTC must require all internet enabled consumer products to employ end-to-end encryption by default. The FTC should also require companies to regularly perform data privacy, civil rights impact audits.
    Make privacy policy statements comprehensive, readily readable but concise by eliminating all the jargon and legalese on the one hand and by eliminating all intrusions on the privacy of the individuals using and to whom the tech industry sells, leases or otherwise entices the public to use their products and services.
     In other words an impenetrable wall must be placed between the data we enter when using tech companies' products and services and any use of that data beyond filling in blanks on forms.

Right now it is upside down and backwards, with companies doing whatever they want and users obliviously cooperating.  Opt-out, do not track need to be the universal defaults.  Right now, it is a time-consuming and laborious process to stop companies from collecting your information and using it however they want.  I am a tech-savvy person who often stops to see just what ""accept all cookies"" means in each case.  It often means way too much with too many choices unclearly explained.  A company like Microsoft that once used to sell a product rather than profit from data and whose Outlook is commonly used by businesses and educational institutions has a particular long and disingenuous process with lovely graphics to distract you to get through and to stop some of their data collection--from an email account you're required to use for work!  Not right.

I've noticed too as an educator that the youngest generation is very good downloading apps and shopping online but is often completely clueless about how the companies behind them operate.  They are being tracked and surveilled right and left.  And of course all this information is easily hacked, or sold to the wrong entity.

For some reason, tech was given a privileged status early on, that it could do things other companies couldn't because it was different.  But this kind of tech is not advancing knowledge, it is misleading consumers and even readers into providing them with data under the guise that they are providing a service, which is not really their main aim.  

There also needs to be some anti-monopoly work here.  The amount of power Amazon has been able to collect, surveilling users on multiple platforms--users who are often unaware that Amazon owns them all is absurd.  Imdb, goodreads, abebooks, Amazon itself, AWS, security the Ring--and they want to be allowed in healthcare?  Zuckerberg with Instagram, Facebook, and Meta.  And they don't even pay taxes.  This is absurd and does not need to be the future.

It is time to go back and straighten out the web and make it work for the American people not the companies that would exploit them.  Thank you for starting the process!",,,,,,,

Companies can request user data by clearly letting know what kind of data will be shared with third parties but not just buried in some terms or conditions document just for the sake of clearly disguising the average public cleverly. User-sensitive data should be very carefully handled and most companies should not be allowed to request data in a non-meaningful way from the user which sometimes doesn't even correlate to the core functionality they provide.

Little do they know; these companies are doing more than providing them with a better browsing experience. They might not necessarily sell our data, but they are using it for targeted advertising. Advertising companies are quick to point out that they sell ads, not data, but don’t disclose that clicking on these ads often results in a website collecting personal data. In other words, you can easily give away your information to companies that have paid to get an ad in front of you.
	I believe there needs to be some sort of regulation on how companies collect and utilize our data. All these things take place so fast and we as consumers don’t even realize the number of targeted ads we receive; it’s very concerning to begin seeing ads for things I need but never specifically searched for. It feels as if our privacy isn’t even a concern for these companies, we are just another way for them to make money. There needs to be publicly available logs of all public information that is collected and a simple/easy way for consumers to opt-in for collection/distribution of their information.

As technology evolves, the method in which data collection is executed by businesses may shift. Businesses gather extensive information from consumers which catalyzes concerns of privacy and data usage. It is critical that the FTC implements safeguard procedures to better protect the information used by businesses.

When I was in high school and read books like 1984, Brave New World and Fahrenheit 451 - I though tit would be impossible to get listening devices in everyone's homes.  Big tech found a way to get us to purchase it and install it ourselves!!  Now they are using something we purchased as an ""assistant"" to gather information on us and sell it (whose ""assistant"" is is it mine or googles?- fells like googles assistant to me).  Most people think they are a customer of Facebook and other social media applications - you are not the customer - you are the product - your information is what is being sold and how they are making money.  People should be aware of what privacy rights they are giving up.  Companies forcing people to give up their privacy in order to provide basic services should be forced to be completely  transparent in how the information they are gathering is being used.  People should be able to easily opt out of the information sharing and selling.  These information markets should also be looked at and regulated to make sure that the people/companies buying the information are not using it for fraudulent purposes.  Technology tends to move faster than regulation but it is time for regulation on information selling/sharing to be brought up to date to address modern day concerns.  ",,,,,,,

I have been and am increasingly disturbed that tech companies and use of technology surveil our communication, interests, purchases and habits at every level - no business or industry or government should have this kind of power over our personal lives. 

Commercial surveillance has become invasive in mining our personal information. I was most recently disturbed by this as I traveled internationally, having my photo taken by the airline without my permission and with no explanation of how it would be used or stored for future use.

I urge the Federal Trade Commission to establish and enforce regulations that ban the use, sale and dissemination of facial recognition technology thus guaranteeing that we have and retain full control over our personal information, including our image, our voice and our location.

Companies currently use techniques to collect data and then share it with third parties. 
I am constantly disturbed that any purchase I make is tracked and shared, evidenced by the fact that companies with whom I have never communicated are soon advertising to me. 

I urge the Federal Trade Commission to require all internet enabled consumer products to employ end-to end encryption by default and to require companies to regularly perform data privacy and civil rights impact audits.

I urge the Federal Trade Commission to establish regulations that limit data controllers to the collection of personal information to what is directly relevant and necessary to accomplish a specified purpose for their business, and establish regulations that ensure they retain that data only for as long as necessary to fulfill that specific business purpose. 

I urge the FTC to enforce the principle of data minimization - minimize and avoid the collection and use of personal data of users and enforce legal privacy requirements, such as informed consent, transparency, right-to-data subject access, purpose specification and purpose binding and security, in order to safeguard the lawful processing of personal data.

Unless the Federal Trade Commission establishes regulations and controls such as the ones I have mentioned personal privacy will end and our personal lives will be increasingly mined by whatever technology or business deems them useful. 

Thank you for your attention to my concerns.

When we launched our business, we had no way to market our services, so we tried various platforms such as Google, Reddit, Facebook, and Instagram to find our initial customers. While we had no data to target our first set of customers, we attended conferences, specialized events, and schools to find our early adopters. After conducting a series of surveys, we collected data and leveraged that data to find similar customers. Without personalized advertising on social media platforms, we would not have been able to build a loyal customer base to keep us business. 

We benefit from personalized advertising and how the ad-supported internet provides free services that we rely on (e.g., Google Search, Maps, Business Profiles, and Workspace), particularly at a time when costs are going up due to inflation.

Version 1 of this document was provided to the FTC in October 2016 and version 2 was submitted to FTC hearings on competition, consumer protection and privacy in March 2019.   

This current version was already a work-in-progress prior to the FTC's announcement of this ANPR so it does not specifically map to the questions asked in it, but from our review the ones that are addressed throughout this document, including in the new Remedy Section, are:

1, 3, 4 thru 16, 19 thru 22, 26, 27, 29 thru 33, 36 thru 38, 40, 41, 43 thru 47, 49 thru 52, 73 thru 78, 81 thru 87, 89, 90, 91, 94, and 95.

For example, we address the ANPR's questions 41, 86, and others on how companies can use various technologies to create unique advertising IDs (for targeted advertising monetization) separate from OSI Model Application Layer 7 unique advertising IDs, like Alphabet currently uses with its Android operating system.  We cover at length how Alphabet could combine the use of underlying TCP/IP technologies and protocols - such as Layer 5 Socket Session Unique IDs - with commercially available hardware, software, and networking products to create unique advertising IDs.  It could then use them to deliver targeted advertisements thereby doing an end-run around potential FTC regulations prohibiting the use of either unique advertising IDs or targeted advertising in general.  

This document also provides additional insights and ideas regarding data privacy that the FTC should consider as part of this (or other) ANPR, including the tracking of children, facial recognition, data mining and the creation of personal data profiles, geo-location, geo-tracking, web-tracking, and more.  We also address competition, national security, consumer protection, constitutional, transportation tracking, health, and quality of life issues with respect to Alphabet's business and the tech industry in general. 

As noted above, a major addition to this version of the document is the Remedy Section, which includes 79 recommendations for the FTC and DOJ to consider for many privacy, competition, national security, consumer protection, quality of life, and other issues raised by Alphabet's overall business model, Alphabet's LinkNYC Wi-Fi and Advertising Network, the tech industry in general, and retail outlets, financial institutions, and data brokers.  Some remedies are fairly straightforward while others are more complex and include extensive explanation and discussion.   Consider the recommendations as a starting point to ruminate over and please put seasoned and veteran staffers on this document.  

Other major additions to the document include: clarifications regarding MAC Addresses and Converted MAC Addresses and their anti-privacy and anti-competition characteristics; a more extensive treatment of packet sniffing and how it can be used in anti-privacy and anti-competitive ways as well as how it can be used in the creation of unique advertising IDs for targeted advertising; an additional analysis of Alphabet's claim that ""over 25%"" of NYC residents can't afford broadband access and the percentage of LinkNYC EBKs installed in Manhattan; a deeper explanation of the anti-privacy and anti-competition nature of the IPv6 Address; the differences between IPv4 and IPv6 Addresses with respect to privacy and tracking; how the FTC should consider getting more involved in technology standards organizations with respect to privacy and competitive concerns; discussion of how Alphabet could be engaged in accounting gimmicks to make it appear it is generating revenue from its monopoly LinkNYC advertising business when it really might not be; and more.

In addition, there are other new areas in the document, such as our creation of the concept of the Privacy Competition Connection, which refers to how violations of device and personal privacy are integral to competitive and anti-competitive actions on the part of tech companies.  We believe the Privacy Competition Connection is a key concept to support the FTC and DOJ's inclusion of end user and device privacy into their statutory obligations to the public.  Please read the Definitions section to understand the terminology and concepts we use - as well as the scope of material addressed - in the document.

New sections and text where significant or material updates have been made from prior versions of this document are color-coded in blue highlight for easy identification.

"FTC-2022-0053-0321","FTC","FTC-2022-0053","l9e-hblp-umfy","Public Submission",2022-10-20T04:00Z,false,,,"Comment Submitted by Anonymous",,,false,FTC-2022-0053-0001,,,,2022-10-18T04:00Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Anonymous","Anonymous",,,,,,,,,,,"Dear FTC,

As a former teacher in New York, I address question 14 on commercial surveillance practices harming minors. I answer that the FTC should declare the commercial collection of face-recognition data on minors unlawful as inherently unfair. The Commission should now recognize that private seizures of children’s face-recognition data are widespread interferences in kids’ choices about what to buy, how to apply their education to commerce, and whether to trust markets. Parents concerned about schools’ influence on their kids should be far more worried about corporations militating ideas that minors only express online to manipulate them into losing money, knowledge, or happiness. When companies can connect kids’ secret online thoughts to their face-recorded public behaviors will be the night that childhood dies.

Face-recognition data is uniquely difficult to keep private because driver licenses alone capture 238.2 million Americans’ faces, see How Many Licensed Drivers Are There in the US?, HEDGES & CO., and face IDs are often required for non-ATM banking transactions, in-person credit card purchases, verifying age at drinking or adult establishments, or safety at airports, corporate offices, schools, or government buildings. Consent cannot be stretched to its thinnest thread as if mere presence before face-recognition cameras surrenders the “privacies of life.” See Carpenter v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 2206, 2217 (2018) (citations omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted). Children could not consent anyway because their parents choose where they live, attend school, enjoy recreation, and engage in worship. So I will highlight (1) how companies lure children into surrendering their face-recognition data with baits stronger than strangers with candy and (2) why the use of face-recognition data profoundly harms marginalized kids. 

Greedy companies entice bored or rebellious children to indulge in instant gratification. While adults tend to identify home as their private space, teenagers are often hypersensitive to parents entering their rooms or overhearing their conversations. Adolescents define privacy more by who is present than by how the area is arranged, so they seek sanctuary in online communities or outside. See Danah Boyd & Alice Marwick, Social Privacy in Networked Publics: Teens’ Attitudes, Practices, and Strategies, A DECADE IN INTERNET TIME: SYMP. ON THE DYNAMICS OF THE INTERNET & SOC’Y, Sept. 2011, at 1, 3-4. Youths especially overestimate the privacy of social media and physical spaces used by fewer friends. See SONIA LIVINGSTONE & JULIAN SEFTON-GREEN, THE CLASS: LIVING AND LEARNING IN THE DIGITAL AGE 97 (2016). Corporate manipulation is apparent because children fear even basic cameras surveilling their movements for a fraction of the time that they spend swiping in apps. Surveys of more than 54,000 students showed that cameras inside schools made them feel less safe. SARAH LINDSTROM JOHNSON ET AL., Surveillance or Safekeeping? How School Security Officer and Camera Presence Influence Students' Perceptions of Safety, Equity & Support, 63 J. OF ADOLESCENT HEALTH 732, 732-738 (2018). Indoor cameras made students feel spied on and emotionally threatened. See Linda Carroll, Some School Security Measures Make Kids Feel Less Safe, REUTERS (Sept. 27, 2018). Yet we risk a future where regular cameras are replaced with face-recognition systems linked to permanent records about them.

The most destructive attacks on youth are when algorithms perpetuate stereotypes, particularly against children of color. Black youths are more than four times as likely as their white peers to be processed into juvenile facilities. JOSH ROVNER, Black Disparities in Youth Incarceration (2021). Face-recognition calculations incorporating recordings of Black children confronting racism reinforce the lie that they are angry. See Amy G. Halberstadt et al., Preservice Teachers' Racialized Emotion Recognition, Anger Bias, and Hostility Attributions, 54 CONTEMP. EDUC. PSYCH. 125, 128 (2018). Private security already racially profiles some of the most academically accomplished young adults of color. See, e.g., Sharon Otterman, Black Columbia Student’s Confrontation with Security Becomes Flashpoint over Racism on Campus, N.Y. TIMES (Apr. 18, 2019). Giving already-prejudiced people data that bolsters their suspicions of vulnerable kids will only create more tragedies or deaths by a thousand microaggressions.

So please declare unlawful the private collection of face-recognition data on kids. Businesses have a profit motive to exploit their psychology to seize such data unfairly. Security, credit, and other character evaluators will have their biases reinforced by society’s prejudiced inputs. Children cannot consent to surrender data on their unchangeable faces permanently. And no benefits to kids can outweigh these harms too prevalent for mere whack-a-mole injunctions to stop.

I am the Marketing Manager for Kiva Dunes Resort in Gulf Shores, Alabama. Kiva Dunes is a family owned business that has been open since 1995. Digital Marketing with pay-per-click campaigns have dramatically improved our business by increasing rounds of golf, vacation rental revenue and restaurant patrons. When I say dramatically increase, we have seen a 256% increase in sales in the last four years. Kiva Dunes is able to advertise to a demographic that is interested in our services, and also to people within driving distance or cities with direct flights. We have many competitors in the area, and our website does not always rank on the first page of a search browsers. With digital advertising our family own business is able to keep up with national brands like Vacasa. This is all credited to online ads and platforms such as youtube, search ads, display ads and so forth. ",,,,,,,

Just because I use Google or Facebook doesn't mean I want them to track my every move and record all of my private information!  

In fact, I DON'T use Facebook because I don't want everyone and their brother to know everything about me.  However, that's not an option for everyone.  The only reason I can get away with it is because my husband and daughter are on Facebook so I can see family photos and updates through them.  I can't avoid Google, however; my job requires me to have a Google email account. 

My point is that using Google and Facebook are no longer choices for most of us.  Our jobs and lives require us to use them.  Therefore we HAVE to sign the consent agreements that say we agree to their practice of gathering all of our private information and tracking our location, etc.  But we really don't.  It's blackmail.  We require their services.  There isn't an alternative.  So we are forced to agree to let them surveil us.

Big Tech’s reckless hoovering up of massive amounts of data is causing harm to everyone. Here are some specific actions I urge the FTC to take:

    Crack down on commercial surveillance, including banning the use, sale and dissemination of facial recognition technology and give users full control over their personal information like image, voice and location.

    Enforce the principle of data minimization. Companies use underhand techniques to collect data and then share it with third parties, as well as using it to predict personal behavior and inferring identity. The FTC must impose strict data minimization rules to stop these abusive data practices.

    Protect consumer data. The FTC must require all internet enabled consumer products to employ end-to-end encryption by default. The FTC should also require companies to regularly perform data privacy, civil rights impact audits.

While I've turned off Siri, it appears a search for a topic that somehow ends up on Google (even though I started on DuckDuck go to maximize privacy) does the same thing. It's as if the only way to get away from intrusions upon our privacy is to give up our phones and computers. Unfortunately, that is no longer feasible for most of us in the world who work and have families.

Please take steps to crack down on commercial surveillance. Limit the ability to share facial recognition technology and help us control our personal information like image, voice and location. I was literally in tears this morning after reading how the Sandy Hook parents who lost children had been tracked even across the country and had details disseminated about their address and contact information. Where has common respect for each other gone in our country?

Please enforce the principle of data minimization to stop the abusive practices of collecting personal data in underhanded ways and then sharing it with third parties, and predicting personal behavior and interring identity. For example, I receive emails I did not ask for from both political parties, likely because I read news from different sources to understand the points of view of people who do not share my views (and I often learn of another way of looking at things as a result).

Please protect consumer data, as well. Consumer products enabled by the internet should be required to use end-to-end encryption by default. The FTC should also require they perform regular audits of data privacy and civil rights impacts.

This is an urgent matter for our country (and the for world, actually). Please help the US take strong steps to protect its citizens from predatory companies.

Trust should be earned through certification by which the public provably knows that computer systems behave in a formally specified manner. The decision to certify computer systems is an appeal to objectivity which consumers should know to determine if the product or service is ethical and thus usable. We need to ask the important question what is private, proprietary, or public and how do we break down information asymmetries with open disclosure or zero-knowledge proof. Consumers should be owed the right of access that individuals should use to monitor compliance with the general principles governing the processing of personal data, and this is where the FTC could innovate to bring transparency to the public. Data governance at its core relies on regulating computer systems to pre-authorize and certify how data is created, stored, accessed, updated or deleted.

I am submitting this comment regarding new trade regulation rules or other regulatory alternatives concerning the ways in which companies collect, aggregate, protect, use, analyze, and retain consumer data, as well as transfer, share, sell, or otherwise monetize that data in ways that are unfair or deceptive.

I whole heartedly agree that the evolving & ever-expanding practice of commercial surveillance is putting consumers at unnecessarily high risk, & exposing them to financial, mental, physical, and emotional harm.

These parties (some known, most are unknown) who collect and trade consumer data are using our habits & our digital footprints in unregulated and ultimately undesirable ways, with Zero oversight, Zero accountability, and Zero transparency.

Consumers (in all but physical presence) are being sold like Slaves.
My Data, my whereabouts/location, my habits, my purchases, my medication, my image & likeness, ARE ME, and SHOULD be protected. Customers should have full control over their personal information.

Please create new Rules, Policies, and Legislation, that will curb these deceptive & secretive data brokering, and strengthen consumer protections that will SEVERELY limit the data being collected,
as well as bought & sold.

Thank You & your Staff, for your time and consideration in this matter.

Misuse of personal data is incredibly harmful to children, to people of color, and to people with any kind of marginalized status including the large percentage of people in poverty.

Here are some specific actions I urge the FTC to take to protect all of us:

    Crack down on commercial surveillance, including banning the use, sale and dissemination of facial recognition technology and give users full control over their personal information like image, voice and location.

    Enforce the principle of data minimization. Companies use underhanded techniques to collect data and then share it with third parties, as well as using it to predict personal behavior and inferring identity. The FTC must impose strict data minimization rules to stop these abusive data practices.

    Protect consumer data. The FTC must require all internet enabled consumer products to employ end-to-end encryption by default. The FTC should also require companies to regularly perform data privacy, civil rights impact audits.

It is long past time to take our data seriously, and to not allow these companies to mine us and our information for their profit at our peril.

We’re headquartered in Fairfield, Iowa, which has a population under 10,000 people. As a result, most of our sales come from the internet, so digital advertising is a big part of our marketing strategy and our business success.

I’m concerned that the Federal Trade Commission is considering new rules about data collection that could - if not done carefully - really impact digital advertising and quickly hurt our business. 

The amazing thing about personalized digital advertising is that we can target people interested in safe, eco-friendly products that won’t cause harm to them, their pets or the environment. We don’t waste money advertising to people who aren’t interested in our products, and our ads don’t intrude in the media of people who would be offended by them or just aren’t interested in what we offer. Digital advertising is a win-win for business and for consumers. 

If the Commission does something that makes our advertising and social media marketing more expensive or less effective, there’s no doubt our costs will increase and our business will suffer. I’m confident that is not the Commission’s intention - but an inartful regulatory sledgehammer aimed at the big digital platforms will crush thousands or millions of small businesses. 

Thank you for considering our view, and the concerns of small businesses that live and succeed thanks to the internet, online platforms and data-driven digital advertising.

Every year we make thousands of customers happy and our business is growing nicely. I'm filing this comment today because I'm worried about the Commission’s consideration of new rules regarding data collection and data processing, particularly as the new rules are likely to change how digital advertising works. 

Online advertising is incredibly affordable and effective. It helps us reach potential customers throughout the area, and to compete against big chains with big advertising budgets, like Bennigan’s and Texas Roadhouse. 

The data behind digital ads is precisely what makes them so effective and affordable. I'm concerned that our family business will be less competitive and less successful if the Commission writes new rules governing data collection and data utilization. I realize there are concerns about privacy and that data misuse can be problematic, but we don't know who sees our ads or where those people live - we just know that the ads work and we get new customers.

On behalf of millions of small businesses that rely on digital advertising to grow and succeed, I urge the Commission to not make any changes that could increase our costs or make digital advertising less effective.

Relatively ignored is the frequency of errors in personql dataq collected by these commercial firms.

As an example, because I have a fairly common name, my birthdate is routinely incorrect, my job history distorted, my wife misidentified.  My experience urging credit bureqausn andn others to correct their records is sheer futility.  The local buildings department is no better, recording a rental property I own that was built in 1895 as dating from 1947, which is when its neighboring two car garage was built.

While courts have long acknowledged that Fourth Amendment protections extend beyond physical space into the digital realm, the supposedly voluntary nature of data disclosures circumvents constitutional safeguards. By allowing the sale of user data (often incorrect), privacy law allows law enforcement to buy their way around the Fourth Amendment unhindered. The Fourth Amendment provides vital protections against the targeting of people based on race, religion, or ideology. The lack of clear constraints on surveillance powers raises the specter of racial, religious, and political profiling. Clearly, constitutional safeguards have not translated effectively into the digital age.

In the hands of law enforcement, everyday digital business practices become weapons of surveillance. Third-party data brokers market data culled from thousands of apps to law enforcement and federal intelligence agencies, subjecting millions of Americans to intrusive surveillance without the protections afforded by search warrant requirements. For these reasons, I believe the FTC should intervene against the sale of consumer data to law enforcement and intelligence agencies.

US regulators want to crack down on Big Tech’s shady surveillance machine, but tech companies are fighting back hard.

Send a message to the Federal Trade Commission and show there’s massive public backing for strong laws to protect your privacy online.

 SUBMIT COMMENT 

Ann,

Google and Facebook have made billions of dollars from stealing our personal data and then using it to track and target us across the internet.

And we’ve already had a glimpse of the terrifying consequences of tech companies spying on us - wiith law enforcement using Google’s data trove to track women visiting abortion clinics.

Now US regulators have had enough and want to crack down on Big Tech’s mass surveillance machine, but tech companies will fight tooth and nail to derail new privacy laws.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is calling for public comments on these new privacy laws. This is our best chance yet to end Big Tech’s predatory practices for good but we only have a week until the consultation period closes so we have to act fast!

We’ve put some points below that you can use to draft a comment, then click on the link below to go straight to the FTC website to submit it.

Send a message to the Federal Trade Commission telling them to protect our privacy.

Here's a template message you could use as the basis of your submission to the consultation, though it’s most powerful if you use your own words:

 

Big Tech’s reckless collection of enormous amounts of data is causing harm, particularly to the most vulnerable members of society like people of color, members of the LGBTQ community and kids. Here are some specific actions I urge the FTC to take:

Crack down on commercial surveillance, including banning the use, sale and dissemination of facial recognition technology and give users full control over their personal information like image, voice and location.

Enforce the principle of data minimization. Companies use underhand techniques to collect data and then share it with third parties, as well as using it to predict personal behavior and inferring identity. The FTC must impose strict data minimization rules to stop these abusive data practices.

Big tech's relentless data collection, processing and dissemination for profit or politics robs everyone who uses the internet of their personal autonomy.  It especially harms the most vulnerable among us - kids.  It bolsters and perpetuates systemic racism and homophobia. It's long past time for the federal government to reign these companies in:
1) Crack down on commercial surveillance, including banning the use, sale and dissemination of facial recognition technology;
2) Give users full control over their personal information including image, voice and location.
3) Enforce the principle of data minimization. Companies use underhand techniques to collect data and then share it with third parties, as well as using it to predict personal behavior and inferring identity. The FTC must impose strict data minimization rules to stop these abusive data practices.
4)Protect consumer data. The FTC must require all internet enabled consumer products to employ end-to-end encryption by default. The FTC should also require companies to regularly perform data privacy and civil rights impact audits and publish the results, or hire independent third parties to perform the audits.

Send a message to the Federal Trade Commission and show there’s massive public backing for strong laws to protect your privacy online.

Naomi,

Google and Facebook have made billions of dollars from stealing our personal data and then using it to track and target us across the internet.

And we’ve already had a glimpse of the terrifying consequences of tech companies spying on us - wiith law enforcement using Google’s data trove to track women visiting abortion clinics.

Now US regulators have had enough and want to crack down on Big Tech’s mass surveillance machine, but tech companies will fight tooth and nail to derail new privacy laws.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is calling for public comments on these new privacy laws. This is our best chance yet to end Big Tech’s predatory practices for good but we only have a week until the consultation period closes so we have to act fast!

We’ve put some points below that you can use to draft a comment, then click on the link below to go straight to the FTC website to submit it.

Send a message to the Federal Trade Commission telling them to protect our privacy.

Here's a template message you could use as the basis of your submission to the consultation, though it’s most powerful if you use your own words:

 

Big Tech’s reckless hoovering up of massive amounts of data is causing harm, particularly to the most vulnerable members of society like people of color, members of the LGBTQ community and kids. Here are some specific actions I urge the FTC to take:

Crack down on commercial surveillance, including banning the use, sale and dissemination of facial recognition technology and give users full control over their personal information like image, voice and location.
Enforce the principle of data minimization. Companies use underhand techniques to collect data and then share it with third parties, as well as using it to predict personal behavior and inferring identity. The FTC must impose strict data minimization rules to stop these abusive data practices.
Protect consumer data. The FTC must require all internet enabled consumer products to employ end-to-end encryption by default. The FTC should also require companies to regularly perform data privacy, civil rights impact audits.

Please take this seriously. People can be harmed when their personal data is collected and it can be used against them, such as when Google is tracking women visiting abortion clinics. A young woman was already arrested for seeking abortion care in this country. Do we not have the right to control our own bodies, as well as control who has access to our personal data? I don't want to live in a world where Big Brother (or tech companies) are watching our every move.

2.) Enforce the principle of data minimization. Companies often use underhanded techniques to collect data and then share it with third parties, as well as using it to predict personal behavior and inferring identity. The FTC must impose strict data minimization rules to stop these abusive data practices.

3.) Protect consumer data. The FTC must require all internet enabled consumer products to employ end-to-end encryption by default. The FTC should also require companies to regularly perform data privacy, civil rights impact audits.

This is by no means an exhaustive list, but it would be a good start.  I urge you to keep monitoring Big Tech companies on the ways they use data and make sure that ordinary people remain protected.

Thank you for your attention to this urgent issue.

I would also argue, as it similarly states in the description of this rule, that most individuals in the United States do not understand or realize that their data is being collected and traded amongst different entities. I was recently made aware for the first time that retailers have the capability to passively track an individual’s location throughout their store by following their smartphone’s electronic emissions. This information can be used by the retailer to locate different areas in their stores where consumers spend more time, less time, etc. As a consumer, this was alarming because I was unaware information such as this was being tracked by a system without my consent. This is just one way that companies surveil their customers. 
Another method, which was mentioned in the description, is the monitoring of a web-page user’s path throughout the company’s website. This tracking serves a similar purpose to tracking individuals in their stores in that it helps these companies understand what consumers are targeting. This surveillance is not as much of a concern as when the data detailing the path the individual took and the profile that is created for them based on their internet traffic is sold to different entities and that person’s preferences, information, and on-line habits are now used and exploited as they venture to other sites. As the consumer’s data is passed along to different entities their profile becomes more elaborate and their information becomes more exposed. The concern is that the information collected becomes so precise that their profile is as accurate to the actual person as it can be. Companies now are at risk of discriminating against the individual based on their profile that has been created online. Not to mention, the more this individual’s personal information is passed from entity to entity, the higher risk their information is used in some sort of cyber-attack or malpractice. 
In response to question 10: The rule should highlight specific information which is subject to trade regulation. The information that should be subject to trade regulation is personally identifiable information, sensitive information, and data that is linkable to a personally owned device. By regulating the trade of this type of information I believe the commission will be better equipped to protect individual’s from potential harm from information sharing they are not even aware is occurring.

Google and Facebook have made billions of dollars from stealing our personal data and then using it to track and target us across the internet.

And we’ve already had a glimpse of the terrifying consequences of tech companies spying on us - wiith law enforcement using Google’s data trove to track women visiting abortion clinics.

Now US regulators have had enough and want to crack down on Big Tech’s mass surveillance machine, but tech companies will fight tooth and nail to derail new privacy laws.

Big Tech’s reckless hoovering up of massive amounts of data is causing harm, particularly to the most vulnerable members of society like people of color, members of the LGBTQ community and kids. Here are some specific actions I urge the FTC to take:

    Crack down on commercial surveillance, including banning the use, sale and dissemination of facial recognition technology and give users full control over their personal information like image, voice and location.

I further posit that commercial surveillance of the Internet, and the widespread use of unregulated algorithms to capitalize on data harvested, is concentrating the toxic effects of internet and social media across the entire spectrum of Internet users. The FTC should consult Rachel Carson's novel, ""Silent Spring"", to further study the risks of unregulated business activity pursuant to the advent of new technology. Until addressed by the scientific community, and regulated by the U.S. Government, these toxic effects will continue to concentrate and poison our society much like DDT poisoned the natural world around us.

Where is the line between actual reality, virtual reality by way of the metaverse, mindful interaction with AI, AI chatbots, metaverse communication, mindful interaction with virtual representations of friends, family, strangers by way of any of the aforementioned methods of communication and how do I secure myself from engaging in these interactions? How do I find out who has access to me at any given moment in the age of this technology in order to secure myself from these unknown entities? Furthermore how do I secure my son who is a minor from these very same technologies? Are these mindful interactions and engagements capable unbeknownst to me because of the apps we have on our phones, tablets and computers? Or is it some other means such as my cellphone provider or government agency that I may be affiliated with through some program such as the APC benefit program etc.? How do I find out WHO is forcing these transactions to occur? What are the rules and laws that currently govern these platforms that adults and minors alike are both participating in both wittingly and unwittingly? How do I OPT OUT? Where’s the line for privacy? How much of my thoughts are being absorbed by these technologies and turned from a personal thought into an unwanted public or private communication between me and “. . . .”? Again, how do I opt out? How do I reject these unwanted communications in which I’m constantly being misrepresented? I now have racist words of hate floating around within my thoughts where once I didn't have these words anywhere within my vocabulary. This is unacceptable. I've experienced fabricated scenarios, ""mindfully"", in which the result makes it seem like I'm mindfully attacking someone with words of hate, a scenario that is wildly inaccurate and feels as if its only meant to either misrepresent me or terrorize me with the fear that I am being misrepresented and I am not tech savvy enough to understand how to shut these hidden entities out of my mind. I have no idea if these experiences are occurring on anyone else's end but I perceive it on my end and I associate it as a violation of my own personal security that I feel defenseless against. Why do I not have the ability to identify who has access to me. Without having that information available to me the result is that in ACTUAL reality I am not capable of refusing these unknown entities access to my mind and body. As it stands right now my thoughts, my privacy, my security, my individuality, my personality, my career, my relationships, my emotions, my feelings are all being violated on a constant basis. I spend all my time expressing my desire to be disconnected from all aspects of the metaverse, all aspects of AI, algorithms, augmented reality journeys, augmented reality, virtual reality, AI art violating my thoughts and mind which in turn is ruining the art I create by removing genuine creativity and individual expression through art. I’m attempting to pursue a career as an artist and the entire process is being violated by unwanted AI chatbots, (or is it metaverse communications? Probably both, and both equally invasive and unwanted by me), which disrupt my emotions and creating havoc within the process. This goes into my art and it is not the desired result that I am intending to produce. Not to mention the fear that I now have that all my art is being penetrated to some degree by way of unwanted influence through one of the aforementioned methods of mindful ""tools"" or ""apps"" that I'm unwittingly connected to at any given moment. Why do I not have the ability to secure myself from all of these things? What about my son who is a minor? What's he being subjected to? I'm hearing scenarios in which he is being drawn into adult themed conversations and interactions. If I am to believe everything I've been hearing it sounds to me that through some avenue of metaverse community he may be compromising himself without even realizing it. Where is the manual and set of instructions? This is not something taking place on some physical platform I can hold in my hand and power it off at will such as a phone or tablet, this is happening in my actual mind and body non-stop 24/7. I have been looking at this in terms of an API and I the end user, how do I not have the ability to secure such a sensitive API such as the one that directly connects me as the end user. Shouldn't I have the authority over my own API? Who does have security clearance to me? How do I OPT OUT!",,,,,,,

 - Few consumers understand exactly what data is being collected and how it is being used.  ""Privacy Policies"" aren't very useful because they're written in legalese and intentionally use vague and broad language.
 - Even if you know what data is being collected, very few people actually understand the many real-world consequences of this data collection.
 - Companies try to assuage customer concerns by ""anonymizing"" and ""aggregating"" data. However, there are companies that specialize in cross-referencing all this data and de-anonymizing it. This defeats the entire purpose and is virtually unknown to most consumers.
 - Consumers generally have no choice but to consent to such data collection.  When we do have a choice, it's an ""enabled by default, opt-out later"" type of choice.  For things like mobile apps, the software can actually collect all your information and upload it before you can dig through the options and find the ""opt-out"" button. Non-tech-savvy people often have trouble figuring out how to opt out in the first place.
 - Personal data is frequently collected without any consent at all.  For example, mobile apps like Facebook or LinkedIn collect the names and phone numbers in my address book.  The app developer did not get permission from those people to harvest their information, nor do they ever get notified that their data was collected.  I shouldn't have the power to consent to such collection because it's not my information.  For that reason, it's nearly impossible to avoid having your data collected.
 - Some companies (like Facebook) create internal profiles for people who are not customers.  They do this by aggregating mentions of your name in other people's posts, or by finding you in photos that others post.  These people have not consented to having their data collected, have no control over it. and are not even aware it is happening.
 - Privacy Policies only apply to the company that collected the data. Once that data is shared/sold to another entity, it can be used in ways the consumer never would have originally agreed to. Companies can bypass their own privacy rules by selling data to a third party and then buying it back as a different data set under different terms.
 - There is no way for a consumer to know who has their data, to know what data they have, or to know what it is being used for.
 - Sensitive medical information collected by health care providers is protected by HIPAA.  If an app can deduce your medical information by monitoring your behavior, it can use that information without abiding by HIPAA rules. It's the same data, why aren't they required to follow the same rules?

A personal story about the consequences of lax data collection rules:

I recently went to return an item to a store.  The store ran my information through some sort of third-party system that was supposed to predict whether the return was likely to be fraudulent or not.  My return was denied because the address on this company's profile of me didn't match the address on my driver's license and it assumed my license was a fake.  I have no way to know what address they had on file, and no way to correct it.  As a result, I am completely unable to make returns to any store that uses this particular screening system.  Why must I suffer for someone else's mistake?  At least it only affects returns of purchased goods.  Other people lose jobs, have housing applications denied, etc. due to these ""data analytics"" systems using harvested personal data that is wrong and cannot be inspected or corrected.

At a minimum, I urge you to treat personal information the same way we treat financial information on your credit report.  People know who the credit bureaus are that collect their data, they have a right to see a copy of that data, and they have processes to correct errors in that data. If that data is used in a negative decision against them, they're informed of that fact and get a copy of the data in question (plus instructions on how to correct it if needed).  Harvested/aggregated personal information is being used to make decisions with the same sort of life-altering consequences as credit report data, so consumers should have *at least* the same sort of rights.

The ideal approach would be to look at what the EU has done with the GDPR as an example of how consumer privacy can be protected without a serious impact to innovation. A few basic principles would go a long way:
 - Data collection must be disabled by default (""opt-in"")
 - Cannot penalize a customer for refusing data collection
 - A right to see the data collected about you, correct it, and have it deleted
 - Anonymized data cannot be de-anonymized
 - Every piece of data collected must have a justifiable business reason (""to resell"" is not a valid reason)
 - Individuals can hold companies liable for violations",,,,,,,

Furthermore, the US government needs to see the trade of its citizens' personal information to foreign actors as a national security threat. Silicon Valley may reside inside the contiguous US, but its allegiances are global and diverse. In addition, special care should be taken to restrict or even outright ban certain foreign social media platforms that are designed to subvert and divide a homogenous American culture. For instance, TikTok, the popular video clip sharing platform run by the Chinese company ByteDance, is one of the most invasive apps one can have on their phone. The app tracks presses on the screen, time spent viewing each particular clip, and feeds the user clips it knows will keep them on the platform for longer. The permissions required to run the app are also incredibly intrusive; access to your microphone, CPU data, MAC and IP addresses, and GPS pinging, to name a few.

TikTok is obviously a way for the Chinese government to get Western people - almost always teens and young adults - to voluntarily give up their personal information and ways of gaining access to other platforms they use (internet browsers, online banking, email, etc). It is a bubble waiting to pop, hanging over the heads of hundreds of thousands of users in the West. When the time is right, that mountain of personal data will absolutely be used as a bargaining chip in some foreign policy debacle in order to get the US to back down from a hostile position. The inevitable invasion of Taiwan comes to mind.",,,,,,,

RE: Commercial Surveillance ANPR, R111004
Oct. 18, 2022
To the Commission:

I am submitting these comments in response to the Commission’s advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) requesting public comment on commercial surveillance and data security practices that harm consumers.By way of background, I am the author of the book ""Demanding Medical Excellence: Doctors and Accountability in the Information Age,"" where back in 1997 I began examining the impact of digitization of information on medical care. Previously, I was a reporter for the Chicago Tribune, where I was nominated three times for the Pulitzer Prize.

After leaving journalism, I became a health care consultant and researcher. At present, I am an adjunct associate professor of medicine at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine. I have long been active in health policy issues related to quality of care, patient safety and patient empowerment, including testifying at a May 27, 2003 joint hearing of the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice on quality and information in health care.

In that testimony I urged “transparency” of quality information, and this letter continues that theme. FTC chair Lina Khan has noted that the majority of Americans feel “they have scant control over the data collected on them.” There isan important example of that in health care that none of the consumer groups testifying in the Commission’s September 8 forum, nor the commissioners themselves, appear to be aware of.

As I wrote in a December 6, 2021 First Opinion in STAT News (attached), health plans and health systems are secretly using so-called consumer data analytics, based on data collected by companies like Facebook, Google and many others, that draw upon credit reports, shopping habits, website visits and
many more data elements. The justification is to find patients or plan members who might benefit from early intervention based on their social determinants of health. Because the data is not protected health information as defined by HIPAA, there is no requirement to notify consumers or obtain consent – even
as one vendor boasts of having up to 5,000 certified variables on every adult in America related to clinical, social, economic, behavioral and environmental data.” Moreover, health systems are combining this information with the clinical data in their electronic health record for even greater insights (intrusion?) into patient lives.

Importantly, not only has there been no peer-reviewed, public review of algorithms for bias or even simply accuracy, the literature suggests that researchers are not even aware of the existence and widespread use of this information. Finally, while health systems and health plans are at least using this unregulated, undisclosed and unreviewed data for the purpose of improving individuals’ health, there is no information on who may be buying this same information for different purposes, including discriminatory marketing.

My thanks to the Commission for the opportunity to comment, and I would be pleased to discuss thisissue at greater depth if helpful.

Sincerely,
Michael L. Millenson, President, Health Quality Advisors LLC and Adjunct Associate Professor of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/FTC-2022-0053-0547/attachment_1.pdf",

There is more need to obtain guidelines and processes for data privacy. In addition to the comments, I also would like to see more user training and education about how one can protect their own data. That by managing one's own data, one can generate a level of protection. This education can then allow the end user to make more conscious decisions on how, when and why they share their own data.

When it comes to businesses tracking online data, we need to take all steps to protect children.  As very young children have more access to technology parents need to know that parental protection methods work as they see fit for their child(ren).

I also advocate that there be a common language in the description of data uses, more clarification on what data collection means for the person supplying the data, and more options to opt out of sharing one's own data.  Individuals need to feel safe in using technology and the internet, for many it is a common avenue for daily life; look at us commenting on line about data privacy. The problem is that many individuals that use the internet don't know that they should be concerned, what processes are of a concern, and who to consult with about their concern. Who does one trust? The role of the FTC is as critical today as ever.

There are many avenues for which data privacy needs to be reviewed and addressed. Getting some frameworks in place would be a good starting point and then the details of the various industries, data areas, and specifics can be addressed in as much detail as needed. ",,,,,,,

The harms caused by widespread, unregulated corporate surveillance and data abuses pose a direct threat to people, especially  people of color, women, members of the LGBTQ+ community,  and other marginalized groups. 

In our post-Roe world, these threats have become so much more significant for women. Such harms directly result from the unfair and deceptive mass collection, use, and sharing of peoples’ data.

I fully support the FTC in exercising the full extent of its authority to protect us by addressing the entire life cycle of data, including collection, use, management, retention, and deletion. 

 I urge the FTC to regulate:
- Commercial surveillance technologies.  Right now, there are surveillance devices everywhere. To protect our rights, especially privacy, please ban the use, sale, and dissemination of facial recognition technology, and institute human rights-based protections that give people full autonomy and control over their personal information and digital bodies, including image, voice, and whereabouts.

- Data minimization: We must dispose of the false premise that “accept all'' policies are in any way a sign of meaningful or informed consent. Companies draft privacy language that the majority of the public are unable to read and understand. Meanwhile, the data collected by a company doesn’t always stay with that entity, as companies profit off the sharing of individuals’ data with third-party data brokers. Not only do many people not realize this is a common practice, but it is also unlikely they could understand the potential impacts of how this data could be used as it changes hands. As this data is collected and merged, companies are able to predict personal behavior and infer ones' identity, despite industry claims of anonymity. To address issues with data collection, the FTC should impose strict data minimization obligations on companies and ensure that individuals retain maximal control over their own personal data.

- Data security: After a private entity has collected consumer data, the onus must be on that company to take meaningful steps to ensure the security of that data. Endless examples of cyberattacks prove that the information companies collect is a target for hackers, data thieves, and other bad actors. In order to fully protect consumer data, the FTC must require all internet enabled consumer products to employ end-to-end encryption by default. The FTC should also require companies to regularly perform data privacy and civil rights impact audits to ensure accountability for data security and transparency around breaches and company practices. 


The FTC must use its full authority to not only address issues that are prevalent at present, but to proactively protect users in the future as technology and commercial surveillance practices evolve.

I thank the FTC for launching this rulemaking process and support its efforts to address the harms of surveillance and data abuses.",,,,,,,

It is commendable that the FTC continues to allow for public comments on topics that you will be ruling on. By doing this you are including the public in your mission to protect the public from deceptive or unfair business practices and from unfair methods of competition through law enforcement, advocacy, research, and education.

There must be a call to action for the FTC to hold up its mission and commitment to the “People”!

Any business that is utilizing a person’s, personal information without their consent and knowledge, is “STEELING” from that person.

I ask that you consider your own commitment to customer service through this collection of public comments. You have asked the “Public” (your customers), to help with setting clear expectations. This brings me to the question that I believe we must ask ourselves to stay Objective, given the probable subjective nature of this topic.

Without clear boundaries and expectations, can customer success ever be achieved? There must be specified level of communication for trust (customer service) to be given.

As a business professional for over 18 years, I would find it much more useful to have customer consent on all levels of data collecting and solicitation. Not only do I feel that the unauthorized collection and sell of personal information is against our right to “PRIVACY”, and I also see it as a waste of time, money and energy for companies utilizing such information.

If we had the consumer consent and input on the collection and uses of personal information, we would be more efficient at connecting our goods and services with the right customers. With the current practice of using a consumer’s online habits to market to them, we are guessing at what that consumer wants and needs.

I ask that the FTC instate a “Consumers Right to Choose Act” that forces all data collection agencies and anyone collecting consumer data online, to submit a right to release form online or through the mail to any consumer they wish to collect data from. This release form must cover all intentions of the collection agent or agency with said information. Anytime a company needs to update or access consumer personal information or online habits, the must submit another clear notice on intentions and ask and receive a new release of the information and the purpose intended.

In my professional opinion, everyone wins from this type of ACT. Consumers get to choose what information is shared and who is allowed access to that information. In return, both sides get a cleaner, faster, and less expensive way to connect the right consumer to the right solicitors. 

Brokers should be connecting the right consumer with the right solicitor and with transparency and open lines of communication customer expectations and customer success can be achieved. 

As you make your decision and prepare any regulations, I ask you to consider the Bill of Rights and our constitution. If the government is barred from unreasonable search and seizure of an individual’s property, why are solicitor’s and data brokers allowed to seize a consumer’s personal information without legal consent.

“The Fourth Amendment bars the government from unreasonable search and seizure of an individual or their private property.”

“The Ninth Amendment states that listing specific rights in the Constitution does not mean that people do not have other rights that have not been spelled out.”

It is the responsibility of this commission to list the specific rights of consumers in regard to the collection and use of their personal information and online habits.

Direct marketing strategies have become mainstream in business today. With our current practices of collecting, sharing, and selling data, we are merely making a qualitative and quantitative guess at marketing. 

Companies should be regulated to asking for the individual permission of anyone whose information is planned to be used for data collection, sharing, or for profit.

As a result of some of my studies and life experience I have in a city that continues to invest in surveillance in ways that are harmful to citizens, I can’t help but feel like algorithmic discrimination is incredibly present.Just for a brief example –Race After Technology by Ruha Benjamin discusses the way that algorithmic discrimination tends to show up in multiple places –especially in terms of healthcare, hiring, access to credit. All of those things have historically impacted Black people and continues to impact them this day. There’s documented discussion of the lack of treatment, lack of hiring based on names, and having their data being used to deny access to housing and resources within that book and other sources of research. Although one could make the argument that there’s not a lot of intention behind discriminating in some of these systems, the fact that no one has been really been able to take these companies who insist on these practices to task shows that it doesn’t take malicious intent for continuous harms to be inflicted. The lack of transparency and openness between the choices made by those seeking this commercial surveillance really highlights how vulnerable people have been for years to the abuses that come from companies. I also think a lot about the fact that there are so many times that algorithms have mistaken people’s identities multiple times leading to unnecessary arrests and potentially impacting the lives of others to be subjugated by mass incarceration.Between the fact that these companies are using all kinds of data to take advantage of citizens as a whole, the fact that specific groups have been targeted and harmed by surveillance systems –commercial and otherwise means that there has to be action taken by the FTC to establish some kind of rules to contain the impact of these companies unregulated collection and use of data. It has gone way past what should be tolerable and although you don’t have the ability to make offenses for 1sttime offenders, I strongly urge limitations not only one what data can be collected but look into how these algorithms continue to perpetuate and exacerbate existing inequalities across the board. As for examples of what can be done –I would recommend ending microtargeting, ending dark patterns, supporting whatever can give individuals more control over their data and the ability to more easily opt out of these data sharing agreements.",,,,,,,

I own a small creative and marketing agency in Spokane, WA. I am submitting this comment to the Commission’s proceeding regarding data collection and abuse because I would like to urge the Commission to appreciate the importance of data-driven digital advertising to small businesses like mine and virtually all of our small business clients.

The majority of our clients are local restaurants and small businesses. As part of our efforts in marketing for them, we deal heavily with social media marketing and online advertising.The affordability and accessibility of online marketing through digital tools makes it a much more effective mode of marketing for small businesses than traditional avenues such as radio, television, or billboards. These tools allow businesses on a budget to actually reach their audiences and share their messages.

For example, a local billboard near the University district in Spokane costs $1,200/month, a budget most restaurants don’t have for marketing. We recently split that cost across 3 months in digital advertising for one of our restaurant clients and reached, monthly, over three times the projected audience of the billboard, directly bringing customers to their location. We were able to target individuals living near the restaurant, in a nearly-identical manner to a billboard, at ⅓ of the cost.

Not all data-driven marketing and advertising is “surveillance,” as the Commission suggests. Our clients don’t gather data about those who see their ads or even about people who click on them unless the people knowingly submit their data and approve a specific use. Our marketing and advertising are “personalized” because the platforms know, for example, if a Facebook member has “liked” Mexican food or has posted from several Mexican restaurants. The individual is entirely left out of the equation, while the effectiveness of targeted advertising allows small businesses to reach their customers and the customers to see offers and experiences they are interested in.

It is imperative that the Commission not force changes on data-driven advertising that works so well for small businesses. I’m not worried about the platforms, nor do I see this affecting big business, because they have the resources to find ways to make new rules work. But if the new regulations force cost increases or inhibit advertising and effectiveness for my clients, it will directly impact their customer acquisition costs and hurt their ability to grow, hire more employees and succeed locally.

Thank you for considering my views, and thank you for considering small business.

Sincerely,

Bryan Toston

The reason I believe this is necessary is that U.S. law defines children as anyone under the age of 18, with 13-year-olds still included within the age of children. For the COPPA law to be based on legally protecting children yet exclude teenage minors from its protection is misleading. Additionally, it is against the law in most American provinces for minors' personal/private information to be collected and published by public companies. For example, phone books are not allowed to display minors' names or contact information.

COPPA's exclusion of teenage minors, especially 13-year-olds, from its protections is developmentally harmful since they are statistically still vulnerable to publishing private information online with little knowledge of it being collected for commercial purposes. 13-year-olds are still in middle school and their developmental needs are not so different from a 12-year-old's but are significantly different from a high school-aged teen's, let alone an adult's.

If 18+ is too unrealistic a change, 16+ might suffice since the GDPR proposed a bill to extend all existing COPPA requirements to users aged 13-15, essentially raising the age to 16+.",,,,,,,

 My own mother has been called by scammers trying to convince her they were from her bank. She never made her banking information available to anyone online or offline...so it had to come from some sort of tracking, data breach etc. . I personally know of cases of older people who were scammed by criminals abroad pretending to be their children.

 Why do these companies need to hold so much information? Is it really worth it being a little bit more efficient in advertising when you are compromising people's safety? Just stop tracking people at such a detailed level, and then not even the growing threat of data breaches can be much of a problem.",,,,,,,

To date, approaches to disclosure have been underwhelming. Most U.S states do not have solidified, explicit data protection laws. This allows for mass amounts of flexibility in navigating around ambiguous and suggestive regulations that hold minimal repercussions.

One limited exception is California, which passed the California Consumer Privacy Act two years ago. The CCPA only applies to companies that generate 25 million in annual revenue and collect data for over 50,000 of California’s residents. The function of the law is that people have control over where their data is being shared and to whom- accompanied by the right to sue over a data breach and the right to have their data deleted if they so choose.

Further protections must be added to this California law, as the lack of both comprehensive data protection laws and a data protection agency allows for the continuance of “abusive data practices” (2021, EPIC). In presenting this choice to consumers, the following must be considered: the rhetoric used in the disclosure to the client, the acknowledgment to error in judgement, and the careful examination of risks, especially ones that can taint the lives of consumers beyond the period of agreement. 

While these provisions help protect consumers and also keep companies with endless resources in check, there are amendments that give consumers power that does not align in maintaining the goal of implementing accountability for bad actors in businesses. CCPA includes an amendment that closes the 30-day window for retracting data in the event of a foreshadowed lawsuit (2022, Baig). The power shifts to consumers in that they can now sue for any security practice deemed unreasonable or not properly disclosed (i.e., the footer does not include transparency regarding what third parties are able to use their data). If consumers were given the choice to withdraw consent, then some form of a withdrawal window should be present for companies as well- CCPA can be amended to shorten the gap of data withdrawal. 

Regarding the question of if consumers were given the choice of being subject to commercial surveillance- I believe that they are also given the right to waive their rights. It only becomes a matter of ethics if the consumer’s data is being used to research or track an unethical activity. Consent is everything- the effect on the consumer would be kept to a minimum if they had consented to commercial surveillance. Companies, then, should offer this choice when the demographic is appropriate. The consumer must be properly informed and aware of the risks and repercussions of waiving their right to privacy.

The FTC, then, should explicitly outline what demographic that includes, as well as what practices are deemed unfair or deceptive so that consumers are well informed when their data is not protected. Consumers cannot give full consent if what they are consenting to is not clearly defined; it is in the FTC’s best interest to exercise their power and resources more productively to enforce and regulate legislation mutually serviceable for both the consumer and company.

	The prevalence of algorithmic discriminaiton based on protected categories such as race, sex, and age is escalating. Through data collection, platforms are able to create algorithms that determine which advertisements and particular online content will appeal to the user. Furthermore, many advertisers and regulators fail to fully assess how these algorithms facilitate discrimination. Algorithmic discrimination marginalizes users through a lack of exposure to loan, employment, and housing content, expanding upon already existing racial disparities. 
In addition, users of these platforms can also be victims of voter suppression, voter deception, and diluting the voting power of communities of minorities. In an article published by The New York Times, Shane Scott and Sheera Frenkel explain how the Russian Internet Research Agency targeted African American voters on social media platforms. Scott and Frenkel state, “The most prolific I.R.A. efforts on Facebook and Instagram specifically targeted black American communities and appear to have been focused on developing black audiences and recruiting black Americans as assets. Using Gmail accounts with American-sounding names, the Russians recruited and sometimes paid unwitting American activists of all races to stage rallies and spread content, but there was a disproportionate pursuit of African-Americans” (Scott and Frenkel). 
	The FTC’s current method of addressing algorithmic discrimination may not be most effective. During the September 8th public forum, Spencer Overton, President of the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, discusses why a “case by case” approach to regulating commercial surveillance is not always effective. Overton argues that, “litigation on a case by case basis is an important tool but it's not always the best way to prevent or deter discrimation before it occurs.”
	The whole basis of the case-by-case approach essentially ensures that acts of discrimation must occur and be brought into question before being assessed and dealt with by the FTC. Furthermore, the case-by-case approach facilities further discrimination by not providing one set of standards for indetifing and dealing with the issue. This allows the individual in charge of the case to deal with it as they see fit.
A rulemaking approach may be a more effective way to prevent discrimination before it occurs. Having a known set of standards and regulations sets the precedent to companies that acts of discrimination will be peanilzed. I believe this approach adds a greater sense of accountability to companies who break the rules. Additionally, knowing the consequences for their actions would aid in detering these compaines from using algorithmic discrimination in the first place.
	In conclusion, the FTC should consider trying a rulemaking approach for dealing with discrimination to ensure platforms do not have the right to maximize their profits through discriminatory advertisement distribution onto both economically and politically marginalized groups.

                Companies have multiple ways of surveilling their consumers, some of which are less obvious than others. One of these methods is that the companies scan their users’ personal data, their browsing history, interactions on posts, viewing time on content, etc., and collect it to build a profile that is then used to deliver advertisements that are catered to whatever the person’s interests are. Johann Hari states that these profiles are like “voodoo dolls”. They start out basic and average, but as you keep on going through websites, clicking on posts, and reading articles, that voodoo doll collects this information like different parts of you, adding it to itself in order to understand what would keep your interest the most (Hari) Apps like Facebook are monetized by how long you’re on the site, every second is another cent. So, it’s obvious that they would want to keep you on as long as possible with these targeted ads and filtered content that sends you on a downward spiral to page after page of content until you lose seconds, minutes, hours of your life mindlessly scrolling and reading while they profit off of it. There are also “cookies” and “web beacons” that enable companies to track browsing histories. The way that cookies work is that they’re small files, unique identifiers like a fingerprint that web servers send to browsers. These cookies can then be sent back to the server every time your browser opens a new tab, giving that website a way to remember you, your preferences, and online habits (HP Tech Takes). Web beacons work in a similar way except they can be delivered through a web browser or an email. Companies can also act as data aggregators, purchasing or sourcing consumer data from third parties to then sell to other third parties. It’s not just your laptops or computers that can be tracked either. Mobile phones have their own ways to track your activity like third-party SDK’s (Software Development Kit’s), which are normally used as software building tools, that can source consumer data as well.

 

            In light of the various techniques of surveillance detailed in this comment, the FTC should create some sort of regulation or strategy to decrease the amount of information that websites are allowed or able to take from users on their site. Whether it is a specific amount of information or only a certain type of information that they are allowed to collect. The specifics on those criteria can be determined by the FTC at their own discretion.

QUESTION:13 

I can still remember when my parents let me create my own social media 88account. I was twelve years old in middle school at the height of Vine, Instagram, and Snapchat. All my friends were sharing posts, and they would reference things that had recently gone viral. With YouTube being my only social media source, I was often out of the loop. I was twelve years old when I was first exposed to the different algorithms used my social media apps. My brain was still easily accessible to manipulate; if I happened to see multiple people doing the same thing, I thought it was cool and would copy it. The FTC asks if “there practices or measures to which children or teenagers are particularly vulnerable or susceptible” especially when it comes to them sharing personal information, and my answer is yes.
It is not a secret that tech and social media companies like Google, YouTube, and Facebook often make it difficult for consumers to protect themselves. Jasmine E. McNealy's ""Platforms as Phish Farms: Deceptive Social Engineering at Scale” addresses how harmful phishing can be, especially when directed towards people who can’t identify what’s happening to them, i.e. children, young teens and older people. McNealy says that “platforms are concentrations of power that exploit human vulnerability through their design communicative features, and informational practices. They do so by using deceptive and surreptitious methods that make it difficult for individuals to protect themselves” (McNealy 678). This includes using dark patterns to distract the individual away from what they are searching for (McNealy). For example, in video games catered towards kids there are usually advertisements for other games. You must watch the advertisement for a set amount of time before you can continue the game. If the child sees a game that they like and click to buy the game, if their parent’s card information is already loaded onto the device that they are on, they could unknowingly buy a game. Or if a teenage girl sees an advertisement for make-up that they may like, not realizing that the buyer may be using scamming methods, they could give away their name, address and card information.
 
The recent FTC public forum on commercial surveillance featured Rick Lane, “a volunteer child safety advocate and advisor to REGO Payment Architectures, the parent company of Missoula, the only COPPA certified family digital wallet app and online pay buttons in the marketplace.” A former member of the FTC’s advisory committee on online access and security, Lane (2022) spoke about how there are now new security measures in the works to protect minors’ privacy. I think this is a great way to start. It is so easy for minors to accidentally give up personal information, and because parents aren’t checking to make sure that apps made for kids are being untrustworthy, it makes it easier for dark patterns and phishing techniques to be successful.

Over this past summer, I interned for a cloud computing platform company with my research particularly focusing in on network security. From this short experience, I can reflect of some of what I’ve been able to pick up on general issues within the privacy and data networking space.

The Commission may not need to incorporate state definitions or terms of privacy but should try to consolidate a common roadmap for privacy among the states. Although some acts and regulations like COPPA have set some form of standard, different states provide contrasting definitions of the same term as what the age of “child” is. This is just one example of what has been a mismatch of state privacy laws that require a confusing roadmap for technology companies to store information. This is not just a problem for larger companies, but also small-stage startups are left without many resources to figure out how to become compliant besides unclear state statutory websites. While the Commission creates its regulations, these new rules should work correspondingly to help create a roadmap for uniform privacy compliance and not create unnecessary roadblocks. 

Furthermore, the Commission should deeply consider how voice and biometric information is stored. Chicago has given some semblance of a standard with the Biometric Information Protection Act (BIPA), but much of the litigation in that area falls to unsophisticated judges that cannot distinguish between a data processor and data controller. Voice data is the next frontier for technology companies with the advent of Siri, Google Home, and Echos becoming seamlessly integrated into our devices. Based on recent patent applications, soon, your products will be able to recommend cough medicine if they can recognize that your voice is raspy. While this sounds like an exciting development, this technology gives great risk to abuse by large technology companies to pinpoint even more data points on our files based on our voice data. Voice data can indicate your height, race, health, weight, gender, and mood. While these data points can be implied from general web searches, the amount of information a voice can provide should be considered with great caution. Besides the security risk of holding such personal information, technology companies armed with this revealing information are even more of a position of corralling consumers into self-fulfilling prophecies and echo chambers, eliminating free choice of thought and products. If the Commission considers taking on this great regulatory responsibility, I believe that it should use this vantage point to do something that the government hardly gets the chance of doing: to get ahead of the technology that it is regulating. Unlike Illinois courts and other unsuited government actors, the Commission should arm itself with experts within the field to be better equipped to set these standards.

An important quote from the fourth paragraph of the Overview: ""But, as networked devices and online services become essential to navigating daily life, consumers may have little choice but to accept the terms that firms offer.""

This statement hits the nail on the head, and it goes beyond just use of surveillance and data. The Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policies of various companies, of which the average American is no doubt bound to dozens, give other advantages to these companies even beyond giving them the rights to use your personal data. In particular, the parts of many Terms and Conditions that force consumers to waive their rights to trial, which often disallow class action as well, leave consumers fighting a losing battle: restricted to arbitration and unable to arbitrate collectively, consumers have no power to fight back against violations of their rights. Passing legislation to prevent companies from abusing personal data is important, but as long as arbitration agreements exist, I believe that no such legislation will be effective, as companies will be unable to be held accountable for their actions. I am not sure if this is within the FTC's scope, but if it is, I believe that it is arbitration agreements (which, thanks to the essentiality of modern services that often include arbitration in their terms, are often ""forced"") that are most vital to outlaw, and only once the right to trial can no longer be waived can corporations be held accountable for violations of privacy and other rights.",,,,,,,

I have limited understanding of these technology's that I engage in that are becoming more and more ingrained in how we participate within the world in actual reality.

I fear that much more of my private life is being absorbed by data collection and I feel at a disadvantage not fully understanding where that line actually is as well as not having an easily accessible way to opt out. At what point does one app or service end and the next one begin? What degree do they intermingle and how do I as an end user interact with the process in order to set it up in a way that brings me peace of mind.

I feel most people don't understand the degree of their privacy that is being accumulated and the default settings on all the devices we as consumers buy are enabling the practice to continue. This in itself is concerning to me, now pair that with the newer technologies available and my fears of privacy only increase .

To provide context to my opinions offered, I am a small business owner and marketer that has worked with small business clients in 24 states, helping them design their websites and market their businesses affordably. In addition, my college education had a dual focus in economics and marketing.
While privacy certainly should be maintained and protected, putting the weight of such privacy on all businesses, due to the proliferation of data on the internet, would add disproportionate stress to small businesses.
Our clients are predominantly small businesses, which also make up the backbone of America’s economy representing nearly 44% of GDP, two-thirds of net new jobs, and certainly driving innovation and competitiveness, according to the Small Business Administration (SBA) – https://advocacy.sba.gov/2019/01/30/small-businesses-generate-44-percent-of-u-s-economic-activity/
Those same small businesses are typically unable to access or afford broad advertising methods like sponsorships, traditional mass media advertising on the radio/TV, etc.  As such, they turn to resources like targeted online ads on platforms like Google Ads, Microsoft/LinkedIn Ads, and Meta Ads.  These platforms deliver targeting options (individuals are anonymized) to allow small businesses to get in front of the right audience with their product or service.  
To operate, these platforms rely on the very targeting and tracking data that this committee is considering stifling. Without having accurate targeting data plus appropriate tracking, small businesses will be unable to affordably reach their audience, which in turn hinders their growth and profitability.
Additionally, these businesses also use free platforms like Google Business Profiles, Google Maps, Google Search Console, Bing Webmaster Tools, Google Analytics and more which are currently free to the consumer. If providers of these tools are forced to comply with more and more regulations, they will likely have to start charging for these free services or eliminate them all together to cover the costs.  Either outcome will negatively impact the end-user – a small business which is trying to succeed, create jobs, and create value for customers.
Additionally, tools like Google Analytics (which is completely free) help small businesses track their marketing activities in a dashboard that helps users determine which marketing dollars (and time!) spent leads to revenue generation for their small business. Without this data, small businesses will have a harder time making informed decisions that are critical to their success, which will, in turn, affect growth, hiring, innovation, and more.
I do believe there is a missing link when it comes to privacy: education. Anti-virus and security software companies are continually adding options to protect their subscribers’ data from all websites, and such features can be enabled on-demand. Similarly, new search engines and internet browsers are emerging that have enhanced privacy options for users who would like to be more protective of the data they release. Even the tech giants like Google and Microsoft continue to add various privacy features to their hardware and software applications.
That said, the general public is not educated on how to use such features. However, it is arguable whether the cause for our lack of education is due to “dark, deceptive practices” of the software companies or our own disinterest in reading documentation, terms, and checking our devices’ settings. As a proponent for education, why not implement a basics of security and privacy class at the secondary level which can aid teens (who grow into adults!) on how to protect their privacy, enable privacy features, and make wise choices when using the internet? As an ever-growing digital world, shouldn’t we be focusing on learning how to use technology effectively just as much as music class or foreign language? If we put all the stress on businesses to implement extreme privacy measures, are we sure there will be small businesses to hire those same young adults when they graduate?
I am not calling for lax security or privacy by any means. Rather, I want this committee to fully and extremely carefully consider that further actions to over-regulate this industry and technology do not just affect the behemoths like Google, Meta, and Microsoft. More importantly, they disproportionally negatively impact the small businesses who are reliant on both paid and free technologies provided by these companies.  
Without such targeting and tracking technology, competition in the economy may actually decrease as barriers to entry for running a successful small business increase. ",,,,,,,

I have over 20 years of professional experience developing and maintaining security-related software and services. Today I write as a private citizen, representing only myself. 

I thank the FTC for inviting public comment on this issue and enthusiastically support further FTC action. The FTC should use all available tools to holistically remedy existing and emerging risks arising from commercial surveillance which threaten consumer privacy and personal data to its best ability.

Doing so successfully may improve piece of mind, help sustain the freedom, liberty and opportunity of American citizens online and off, and could set an inspiring example worthy of emulation by other nations.

1. Empower consumers to manage and reclaim that data already collected, shared, and sold with negligible consumer transparency and choice. The FTC should provide consumers with means to report this.

2. Data should be collected only to carry out the activity expressly requested by the consumer, held securely only as long as necessary and no more, then erased. Data collected should not be used for purposes other than originally intended by the consumer, including its sale to or sharing with additional parties. The FTC should provide consumers with means to report this.

3. Drive adoption of strong data security practices. Confidentiality and integrity of consumer data should be protected in transit and at rest. Data no longer needed should be securely and permanently erased. Access to data should be limited only to those with legitimate need, all access audited, and chain of custody recorded if transferred. FTC should help consumers make educated decisions about software and services.

4. Impose restrictions on data broker organizations. (A) Vet new and existing employees to be of unimpeachable character. (B) Regularly train employees to high standards of data security and ethical handling of personal data. (C) Thoroughly vet organizations prior to any sale or transfer of consumer data. (D) Offer consumers a simple means to definitively and indefinitely opt out of collection from all data brokers and/or request deletion of all data collected by data brokers, without the need to identify and make individual requests to each organization. These organizations should be obliged to fully comply with all requests.

5. Ensure companies do not circumvent technical privacy protections or consumer signals indicating a desire to avoid data collection and tracking. A company should not use browser fingerprinting to identify a consumer that has disabled tracking cookies or set a do-not-track header. Penalize the practice of rejoining data sets with consumer identities when such data was previously separated for privacy purposes.

6. Seek meaningful sanctions for organizations whose failure to follow good practice results in unintended or unwanted uses or disclosures of consumer data. The sensitivity and volume of the data and the impact of the incident should inform the severity of the sanction, rather than characteristics (such as business model, structure, size, or revenue) of the sanctioned organization. The FTC should consider incentives and protections for whistleblowers reporting lax security practices and the misuse of collected consumer data.

While I feel these are the most impactful and timely issues for the FTC to address, the commission should also consider:
* protection for vulnerable individuals and communities from discrimination
* protection for those with challenging cognitive and psychological conditions
* user consent obtained through coercion, trickery, or obligation in order to make use of a product or service, including the use of dark patterns and terms of service
* cases where rejecting consent is largely impractical (indirect collection of data, consumer behavioral monitoring in retail stores, workplace surveillance)
* consistent, transparent, meaningful, and understandable notice and consent mechanisms
* risks stemming from access to abundant consumer data and use of emerging deep-fake technology by rogue and adversarial threat actors
* cases where self-reporting by corporations is sufficient, where third-party auditing should be required, and how to align parties to yield optimal outcomes for consumer privacy
* to what degree, if any, technological or policy circumvention such as key escrow can coexist with a goal of protecting consumer data and privacy

I agree that the second-best time to take action on these important issues is now. It is harrowing to consider that many of those now reaching voting age will have grown up accustomed to ubiquitous commercial surveillance. I emphatically encourage the FTC to bias toward timely, decisive action, and thank the FTC for recognizing the critical need to do so here and now, while there is still time.

Respectfully,

...

 - require explicit user consent for the collection, use or dissemination of personal information
  - enforce the principle of data minimization. Companies use underhand techniques to collect data and then share it with third parties, as well as using it to predict personal behavior and inferring identity. The FTC must impose strict data minimization rules to stop these abusive data practices. For example FTC, must limit the dissemination of collected personal information to only the parties that service a transaction or as needed to comply with law enforcement requests  
  - protect consumer data. The FTC must require all internet enabled consumer products to employ end-to-end encryption by default. The FTC should also require companies to regularly perform data privacy, civil rights impact audits.

Corporations such as Google, Amazon, and Meta offer ostensibly low-cost or free online services while monitoring every aspect of their users’ activity.  Real-time location tracking through cell phones and speakers, doorbells, thermostats, and more, enables near-constant data collection. Corporations then sell and resell that data without the consent of the consumers and employees providing that data, and it is used to create comprehensive consumer profiles of personal habits, preferences, and behaviors--for users and non-users alike. That aggregate data feeds predictive tools used to sell targeted advertising, and more concerningly, to make automated, and often biased, decisions around employment, investment, lending, and pricing in the private sphere,  and consequential decisions in public-sector areas including criminal justice, education, and access to public benefits.

But while digital surveillance has become omnipresent in people’s lives, corporations keep the algorithms secret and thus insulated from scrutiny. This creates extreme informational asymmetry between consumers and the companies that collect their data and consolidates power in the hands of the corporations that control the data and algorithms.

Data capitalism has fed the rise of some of the most profitable companies in history, and those market valuations reflect the profitability of exploiting these inequalities. Under data capitalism, employers deploy data technology and biometric tracking to intensify work, reduce worker pay and downtime, and dodge accountability for their workforce, while funneling the benefits of increased efficiency, lower costs, and higher profits to a disproportionately white senior management and corporate shareholder class.

The FTC can help to level the playing field for consumers and workers through rulemaking that requires tech companies to take affirmative steps toward transparency. For example, employers could be required to disclose all workplace surveillance as well as the use of any data collected, both as a part of the hiring process and throughout an employee’s tenure at an organization. The aggregation and sale or resale of employee data to third parties should not be allowed. If employee data is to be sold to third parties, however, it should only be done with the employees’ express consent, and the cost and identity of the data’s purchasers should be revealed. Workers should know the purpose and impact of algorithms being used to track their performance, and should have the ability to negotiate over, and redress harms from, the use of data and algorithms in their workplaces. 

That transparency could also function as a more public form of tech governance. Workers and consumers should have greater control over data governance and oversight over both how their data is managed and the algorithms that their data is used to build and train. Public data trusts--systems of data ownership and management that are under the control of trustees with a mandate to uphold the public interest--and digital cooperative worker organizations already exist across the sector internationally, and could serve as more democratically accountable models for a tech industry that promotes the public good. 

The FTC is also positioned to mandate and set standards for impact assessments of automated decision systems to evaluate accuracy, fairness, bias, discrimination, privacy, and security, and to compel companies to correct any shortcomings or discriminatory outcomes discovered during assessments. Racial equity impact assessments could be used by the FTC to evaluate proprietary decision-making tools like the algorithms used in hiring, housing, and criminal legal processes prior to their implementation, and would provide clear guidance on how to responsibly design and implement automated systems that mitigate and address systemic societal harms, rather than exacerbating them.  A number of models for algorithmic equity assessments exist in the healthcare space, and these assessments should be a requirement for any industry that affects the economic, social, and/or physical well-being of consumers. 

The technology sector is fed by and incentivizes exploitative, coercive, and extractive corporate practices that further entrench corporate power at the expense of consumers, workers, and communities. Regulatory agencies like the FTC have a responsibility to hold corporations accountable to the consumers they represent, and to serve the public good by establishing systems of transparency and public governance over industries that function effectively as essential public utilities.

I am a Ap political and government student that is currently being taught by Dr.Hentze and I've come across this ruling and I want to say that I support this rule due to the fact that most people should be held accountable for their actions upon sharing private information. Many comments pretraining this ruling also says that being unethical in productions should result in losing their license. I believe great lengths should be taken because of the right to privacy some may not agree but for safety purposes this should be brought to attention. Although some may think this is pointless and no real purpose but false information is being put out and this should be handled correctly. Some restrictions should be made on this rule due to the simple fact peoples privacy should be respected upon other reasons. This is a great proposing rule.",,,,,,,

A few of those reasons include the protection of our privacy and data, it prevents companies from selling our information to anyone, and the rule provides punishment for those who do disobey a federal order. This rule creates equality between the consumer of the technological market of the United States and the technology providers of the United States. People should be able to enjoy and seek out stuff on their phones or devices without worrying about their identity being sold or stolen. I personally believe that it is a violation of our ninth amendment when companies not only steal but sell our data and personal information. Businesses, Organizations and Government Entities collecting personal data and sharing it freely with 'third parties' is a huge problem. Default agreements that 'automatically' share personal data should be outlawed completely. Limit what is considered 'necessary data' ie. Healthcare - does need to know what medicines someone takes, or is allergic to, to try to avoid poisoning. Schools only need to know what a student needs to take at school. Schools are becoming FAR too invasive with data collection of minors, who have no say, are not the age of majority, and have no idea what potential damage can be done with data to be used against them. Especially for special education students...many have no idea what schools are asking or collecting. It's SO wrong! You need to fix these significant issues and undo all the personal data that places with no business having, have, and start over with strong policy for the public's/citizens' protection of personal information.",,,,,,,

The EU takes a much stronger approach to data privacy despite being predominantly composed of capitalist nations with citizen internet usage and security concerns not dissimilar from that of the US. The US has a duty to enact new and embolden current data privacy laws by restricting both the collection of data and the processing and sale of personal data. The efficacy of this top down approach can be increased by also working from the bottom up and implementing education for consumer data privacy rights and literacy of data pipelines within the data broker ecosystem. 

The EU’s approach to law enforcement on the matter is a larger sweeping law that covers what they define to be data brokers; the US needs to adopt a policy similar to this in addition to the legislature regulating specific sectors. In doing this there is less room for companies to skirt definitions within the law since law would blanket all data broker corporations rather than only patchwork regulating specific sectors. This leaves room for law to grow and change as the industry does both on a macro and micro scale. It's paramount that this blanket is broad enough to regulate all companies surrounding that data brokering industry. This means including definitions that are broad enough so that the legislature gives rights to regulate internet giants like Google, Facebook, and Amazon that are disproportionately US owned. 

Finally there needs to be a bottom up approach to data privacy law in the form of education. Most end users, especially those of younger generations have a limited scope of knowledge as to how their data is collected, manipulated, used, and how this directly can affect them. Education of these practices is not only a fundamental right for users but plays an important role in a representative democracy in emboldening and creating now data privacy laws.

Reckless data practices replicate and amplify inequities stemming from systemic and historic discrimination. The harms caused by widespread, unregulated corporate surveillance and data abuses pose a direct threat to the public at large, and can disproportionately discriminate against people of color, women, members of the LGBTQ+ community, religious minorities, persons with disabilities, economically disadvantaged, immigrants and other marginalized groups. In our post-Roe world, these threats have become more significant for people who can get pregnant. These widespread harms directly result from the unfair and deceptive mass collection, use, and sharing of peoples’ data.
I fully support the FTC in exercizing the full extent of its authority to address the entire life cycle of data—collection, use, management, retention, and deletion—in order to provide people with significant protection from discrimination and related data harms. Here are some specific actions I urge the FTC to take:
- Commercial surveillance technologies: As surveillance devices flood the market, we’ve seen the installation of the largest private surveillance network in US history. Doorbell cameras, floodlight cameras, AI powered dash cameras, automated license plate readers, facial recognition and other tools of biometric surveillance give corporations roaming eyes in every neighborhood, shopping center, and street in our communities. It’s become nearly impossible to avoid being surveilled in daily life. The unprecedented amounts of data swept up en masse by private surveillance networks give corporations the information necessary to feed development of new products and adopt manipulative marketing techniques without any respect for privacy or even the illusion that people could opt in or out of the system. This surveillance has led to the most intimate details of our lives being monetized and our daily whereabouts tracked. Once companies have gathered this private, sensitive data, it becomes subject to misuse in ways users could never have anticipated. In response to the onslaught of surveillance technologies, the FTC must ban the use, sale, and dissemination of facial recognition technology, and institute human rights-based protections that give people full autonomy and control over their personal information and digital bodies, including image, voice, and whereabouts.
- Data minimization: We must dispose of the false premise that “accept all'' policies are in any way a sign of meaningful or informed consent. Companies draft privacy language that the majority of the public are unable to read and understand. Meanwhile, the data collected by a company doesn’t always stay with that entity, as companies profit off the sharing of individuals’ data with third-party data brokers. Not only do many people not realize this is a common practice, but it is also unlikely they could understand the potential impacts or how this data could be used as it changes hands. As this data is collected and merged, companies are able to predict personal behavior and infer ones' identity, despite industry claims of anonymity. The aggregation of this data allows private entities to conduct discriminatory prediction, which results in biased practices and policies that negatively impact marginalized and vulnerable communities. To address issues with data collection, the FTC should impose strict data minimization obligations on companies and ensure that individuals retain maximal control over their own personal data.
- Data security: After a private entity has collected consumer data, the onus must be on that company to take meaningful steps to ensure the security of that data. Endless examples of cyberattacks that have exposed peoples’ personal, biometric, financial, and other data highlight how the information companies collect is a target for hackers, data thieves, and other bad actors. In order to fully protect consumer data, the FTC must require all internet enabled consumer products to employ end-to-end encryption by default. The FTC should also require companies to regularly perform data privacy, civil rights impact audits to ensure accountability for data security and transparency around breaches and company practices. 
The FTC must use its full authority to not only address issues that are prevalent at present, but to proactively protect users in the future as technology and commercial surveillance practices evolve. I thank the FTC for launching this rulemaking process and support its efforts to address the harms of surveillance and data abuses.",,,,,,,

No matter how one may interpreter the right to privacy, personal information like addresses, social security codes, registrations, birthdays, etc. are all viable to each individual. This personal information collect by many companies will consumers are not aware of why and how the information is distributed. Third parties can buy or hack certain information and create commerce issues like identity theft and fraud. When a customer has to provide information, it should be made more apparent to how the companies will collect the data and how they will use it. Unprotected customer traits like gender, race, sexuality, where they went to college, etc., the information can be biased and create discrimination. Employers and healthcare providers could disadvantage or not accept a person for one of these factors. Numerous daily scenarios occur with the lack of regulation with companies storing, collecting, and distributing personal information that violate the right to privacy. A specific method created by the Federal Trade Commission that specializes in processing individual privacy and preventing unfair collection from research. A clearer understanding has to be addressed to consumers. Just before I submitted this comment, I had filed out all of my information and a precious and specified warning was address that my information could be disclosed to third parties, the internet, and non-governmental websites.

Too many companies collect data unbeknownst to the consumer completely, or they collect it through consent but then use it in a way that wasn't disclosed in the consent form. Companies can then take this data and either use it to create marketing plans or sell it to other companies for their use. Sometimes though, this data can be used maliciously if the sold data ends up in the hands of the wrong company. This situation creates an unfair and deceptive business practice when dealing with the consumer. 

The FTC BECAUSE of Section 5a of the FTC Act has jurisdiction to make a regulatory rule regarding unfair and deceptive business practices. If companies deceive consumers when it comes to collecting data and then create an unfair situation where the consumer has no control over where their data ends up, the FTC should make a rule outlawing this activity. If this rule passes, internet users would be much more confident about where their data is being collected and how it is being used, as companies would avoid breaking this rule for the fear of the punishment that would ensue.

Clean Up Gambling welcomes this opportunity to contribute to the Federal Trade Commission’s proposed rule making relating to Commercial Surveillance and Data Security. Clean Up Gambling has uploaded submissions which provide evidence and analysis concerning the unfair and deceptive practices embodied in the particularly injurious form of commercial surveillance conducted by the online betting and gambling industry. Clean Up Gambling has led the way in uncovering such practices, through our own work and through commissioned expert analyses. Those expert analyses include an (i) in-depth investigation into the data flows occurring as a consequence of commercial surveillance in the online gambling industry and (ii) a detailed review of the legality of such practices in the UK and Europe.  
2.	While Clean Up Gambling is based in the UK, our insights and experience are salient to the proposed rules that the FTC may make given the wider US context that many US states are opening their market to online gambling operators. The evidence Clean Up Gambling has uncovered reflects the FTC’s concerns about “Sophisticated digital advertising systems [that] automate the targeting of … services to the most vulnerable consumers.” When those systems are deployed in an online gambling context, they have harmful consequences for consumers including individual financial ruin, psychological distress and beyond. 
3.	By design of the platforms, consumers cannot know the full extent of processing conducted by remote gambling operators, nor understand the consequences of their profiling, such that the processing is invisible. Nor is it possible to know all the entities that process individuals’ personal data on the instructions of gambling operators. Indeed, despite engaging technical experts over a months-long investigation, even CUG were unable to determine the full extent of the profiling.
4.	The analysis nevertheless suggested that the use of personal data for commercial surveillance by the industry breached the legal regulations on the use of personal information in the UK. Clean Up Gambling accordingly instructed AWO, the leading data rights agency, to conduct a legal analysis of the evidence from the report. That legal analysis resulted in submissions to the regulator of personal information in the UK, the Information Commissioner’s Office. Those submissions set out widespread and systemic breaches of the data protection regulation, including issues relating to consent, transparency and failure to provide agency for individuals to exercise their rights. 
5.	This surveillance is powerful; it allows gambling operators to make commercially important inferences about their customers and personalise their experience of gambling platforms as a result, thereby maximising the amount of time and money spent remote gambling – even with the attendant risk of compulsive behaviour and addiction.",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/FTC-2022-0053-0628/attachment_1.pdf",

However, freedom does not equal invading other privacy or disrupting security, something which lots of people here misunderstood. The US is in dire need for security measures on cyber matters to combat domestic cyber-crime nowadays. I support such regulations to be implemented nationwide like GDPR in Europe and PDPA in Thailand so that crime against data and cyberworld would not go unpunished in the long run.

Privacy vs Security is one of the longest debates in human society. The more security, likely the less privacy, and also the other way around. Both points are very important but it is the balance between both that creates an ideal society for everyone. This applies to the trading field too because building security sacrifices some privacy as well. I think that people with privacy insecurity should learn to understand that the policy is for their sake and also it is important that concerned personnel communicate this.

Moreover, I think that regulations should be applied to alternative categories as well, such as social media. We’ve been reported numerous times how social media exploited our private data for their personal uses. These invade our privacy and create no security, instead mostly harm, to the consumers. If nationwide regulations were to be established, it should take actions against this matter as well so that youth and their customer don’t fall victims to exploitation of data in everyday life.",,,,,,,

These include anti-competitive measures they use to keep their unfair market positions, to actually harming our political discourse and adding to the current level of polarization in society.

I will only touch on aspects of a couple of these.   First, these companies need to be broken up.   I’m speaking of Twitter, Apple, Facebook (Meta), Amazon, Microsoft, and Google (Alphabet).   They force their technology as “bundles” and make it hard for consumers and competitors to interoperate.    Compare how Google’s chrome browser has such market share, not because it’s better than other browsers, but because Google makes it a de facto standard in all of their web properties, as well as steering users to it with their android phone and Chromebook platforms.  

Secondly, another way that big tech is anti-competitive, is that they make huge amounts of their revenue from advertising.    These ad platforms that are all encompassing (and tracking!) for users make it difficult for new competitors to arise.  In fact, it’s these sort of things that cause older companies to fail.  This happens not because they are creating better products, but because of their size.   One example:  Facebook Marketplace has turned Craigslist into a wasteland.  Is Facebook Marketplace better?  No.  But they have the built-in audience of regular Facebook users, and also can use their ad platform to signal products from Facebook Marketplace.

The second way that these big tech companies are hurting users and society is through their gross manipulation of the public discourse.   It used to be “if it bleeds it leads” as a driver of editorial content of newspapers.   But now, it has been put on steroids as content moderation falls to the wayside and “engagement” is the driver.  People who are outraged stay on twitter longer.   People who are outraged stay on Facebook longer (incidentally seeing more ads).   Harmful content on Youtube is responsible for indoctrination of whole new sections of society to violent and discriminatory behavior.

I urge you to please rein in big tech, both in terms of their anti-competitive practices and destruction of social discourse, in addition to all the other issues relating to how these big companies operate.

Thank you.

In the wake of the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision, data security and patient privacy are more important than ever. Smart phones, search engines, and individual websites all track consumers throughout their daily lives, often for the purpose of advertising. This practice can raise serious concerns when the data at issue is sensitive and/or is used in ways that consumers don’t expect, or that could harm them. Even when required to provide disclosures and obtain consent to collect consumers’ data, companies often offer these documents in legal jargon and documents that must be separately downloaded by the consumer before allowing them to access the service. Consumers are incentivized to simply accept all terms and conditions without reading or understanding them. 

Planned Parenthood believes that all data related to accessing health care must be kept confidential, including internet searches for providers or services; visits to educational websites discussing health concerns; searches for directions using a search engine, website, or smartphone; actual location data; and phone calls, texts, or emails to a provider office. As states criminalize abortion and gender-affirming health care, and seek to limit access to contraception, all of this information, if not protected, may end up being used in legal cases against patients and providers. With misinformation spreading across the country, the FTC should require commercial enterprises to limit use of health care and health care-related data across the board.

Planned Parenthood asks the Commission to write tailored regulations to protect consumers’ sensitive data from the potentially dangerous consequences of commercial surveillance and lax data security. In addition to protecting health data, the regulations should require that the retention of location data be both time-bound and tied to furthering the ability of the consumer to obtain a service the consumer has expressly sought. Further, the FTC should take action to ensure that the targeted advertising shown to consumers contains accurate information, especially as it relates to health care services.

When industry is able to, likely to, or already in actuality violating basic constitutional rights, it is not only appropriate but necessary for government to intervene.

Transparency, consent, and choice to opt-out should be bare minimum. Terms and conditions that are not written in plain language do not guarantee these, so there needs to be clear and conscientious guidelines on what expectations are for companies communicating with users.

Companies should be compelled to share how their technologies will impact users the same way doctors are required to inform patients and fiduciaries are required to consider the best interests of their clients. These are not abstract parallels for technologies of all kinds similarly impact people’s health and finances.

This type of government involvement is long overdue and of urgent importance. In addition to addressing those questions currently present before the commission, this body should also address how best to repair the harms that have already taken place.

The following is an emerging form of surveillance whereby a vendor (A) of surveillance equipment is contracted by party (B) to install such devices on real estate property that is owned by B and rented to tenants (C). The surveillance equipment is installed in tenants' private residence; the data collected on tenants by A are not made available to B,(although it's likely possible that B can obtain the data by circuitous routes via the network of data brokers to which A disseminates the data). With this arrangement, B can claim not to be surveilling its tenants within the tenants' private space and thus avoids seeking tenants' consent. Since the transaction is between A & B,  A has no contractual obligation to C, the parties whom A is surveilling.  A profits from the vast quantity of data it collects on C, without any need to obtain consent, and incurs no liability for the harms incurred by C as a result of A's data practices. The opportunity for liability-free monetization of personal data, not only of online activity, but also of physical behaviour, is enormous in the multifamily residential housing market.

The scenario described above is my own personal experience. My landlord recently contracted to install ""smart"" home devices with a vendor that describes itself as an ""enterprise smart home automation company developing software and hardware.""  The ""smart"" devices, which connect to the internet and cellular networks, were installed in every apartment unit, without explicit tenant consent. The landlord even refused to consider requests by concerned tenants to individually opt-out of having the surveillance devices installed in their residences. The devices do not perform functions that are related to the landlord's responsibilities for property maintenance, upkeep or safety, such as leak detection; the landlord markets the devices to tenants merely as ""convenient.""

This contracted vendor's privacy policy, though available to anyone concerned enough to seek and read it, was not presented to tenants prior to installation. Again, because of the 3rd party nature of the tenant's position, the vendor and the landlord can evade any mention of privacy. In contrast, when a user visits a website or purchases a product or service, the user is at least presented with a ""terms and conditions"" document, to which they must consent before proceeding. As unsatisfactorily long and complicated as ""terms and conditions"" documents are, at least the user has the option to reject, unlike myself and all the other tenants at this property.

This vendor's privacy policy is highly disturbing, though probably not atypical of commercial surveillance. According to the policy, the vendor may collect ""identifiers, such as name, email address, online and unique identifiers, IP address; customer information, such as name, address, telephone number, payment card number; commercial information, such as products or services purchased, obtained, or considered; internet or other electronic network activity information, including browsing history, search history, and information regarding a consumers interaction with an Internet website, application, or advertisement; geolocation data; biometric data; audio, visual and other electronic data; profiles and inferences."" The vendor can distribute this massive collection of data & meta-data on every aspect of people's lives for non-service or law enforcement related purposes, to an unlimited number of entities loosely labelled as ""advisors and agents; affiliates and subsidiaries; advertising networks; data analytics providers; social networks; internet service providers; operating systems and platforms; data brokers; business customer/client."" I have saved the full privacy policy as a PDF document and uploaded it as an attachment to this comment. 

To address the harms of this class of 3rd party surveillance, FTC's rulemaking should include the following elements:

The opt-out procedures of data brokers are often highly burdensome and even invasive. For example, some data brokers require that consumers seeking to opt-out, create an account and supply personal data such as birth date and social security number to ""verify"" their identity. No sane person would supply such highly sensitive data to an unknown broker, if their objective is to maintain their privacy. Furthermore, there are many hundreds of data brokers operating in the commercial surveillance market; it is impossible for a consumer to submit opt-out requests to every single broker.
CCPA and CPRA both share a gaping loophole, allowing commercial surveillance entities unlimited ability to disseminate/trade consumers' personal data without consumer consent, as long as they don't ""sell"" the data. Consumers may stop the sale of their personal data by brokers, but have no control over the dissemination of their data under CCPA or CPRA.
 FTC's rulemaking should avoid the weak, unenforceable models of CCPA and CPRA. Instead, privacy protection must be built upon the principle of free, prior, informed consent. Consumers' explicit consent must be obtained prior to data collection, use or dissemination. Data collection must be limited only to that which is required to provide the service. ",,,,,,,

The government should regulate the data collection of apps. There are many people who can be harmed. Many people are sharing their location data with apps unknowingly. Some people do not know the harm involved when an app asks a user if they want to share their location data with them. Besides the harm involved with the general public who is sharing their data, there are also specific cases of harm being done to individuals. A company called X-Mode was collecting location data from Muslim prayer apps, and then profiting by selling the data to military contractors. In this scenario, the app is putting people’s lives in danger, and it could also be considered a hate crime. X-Mode should not be targeting certain groups of people and then selling it to other specific groups who may be using the information improperly. Another app Venntel sold location data to federal agencies for immigration enforcement. Another company sold information about a priest who often went to gay bars to a catholic news outlet. In this scenario, companies should not be selling information about people’s private lives. Selling that information about the priest may have had serious person consequences in his life and his career. 

There are many people involved in causing the potential harm. For example, in the location data industry, the categories involved include collectors, aggregators, marketplaces, and location intelligence firms. Companies that harvest, sell or trade in mobile phone location data are causing the harm. Programmers who provide location data code to app developers to then profit of the location user data are also part of the problem. Location data has been collected on hundreds of millions of people and from more than 1.9 billion devices. 

Apps are also causing the harm by making false promises. Apps claim that the location data will be anonymized and can never be traced back to a user. However this is not always the case. Apps also do not disclose much information about what the location data actually is made up of and in what manners are the users movements being tracked, and how they are using this information. Apps are not clear about these topics, when they should be if they are requesting permission to use such data. 

Companies who are purchasing a person’s location data is also involved in causing the harm. If there was no one willing to purchase the person’s location data, there would be no need for apps to solicit buyers of location data and to collect location data to begin with. Therefore the buyers of the location data are a big cause of this harm. The buyers of the location data may also abuse the location data, and use it for inappropriate purposes. Real estate and businesses are also involved in causing the potential harm because they may use this location data for their own analytics, marketing and advertising. 

There are pros and cons in the blanket approach of not allowing any app have access to any user’s location data. There are various pros for apps having access to a user’s location data. For example, some apps such as the weather app would not be able to work automatically if it did not have location data in order to give the weather information of where the user is. This however can be fixed with instead of having the weather app have the location data, the user can just enter their zip code of where they want the weather. Their zip code could then be automatically saved in the app, which can be used to easily access the weather. This would be less invasive because the user’s location data would not be constantly tracked, and the user can still access the weather easily because their zip code is saved. A major con of the full blanket approach is that people would not be able to use the automatic apps for directions on the spot directions. People can still use the directions apps by entering a starting and ending address, but the app would not be able to announce “turn right here” because the app does not have the user’s exact location. Another downfall is if the user steers off-path, the directions app would not be able to guide the person back on track.  I recommend the government ban all apps from asking for location data except for the use of direction apps. ",,,,,,,

Barring a refusal to use technology, consumers currently face little choice but to sign away their Fourth Amendment rights when they agree to data harvesting in the terms and conditions. This coercive practice circumvents users’ constitutional right to freedom from unreasonable searches, creating a loophole law enforcement routinely exploits to avoid the requirement to obtain a search warrant. 

While courts have long acknowledged that Fourth Amendment protections extend beyond physical space into the digital realm, the supposedly voluntary nature of data disclosures circumvents constitutional safeguards. By allowing the sale of user data, privacy law allows law enforcement to buy their way around the Fourth Amendment unhindered. The lack of clear constraints on surveillance powers raises the specter of racial, religious, and political profiling.

In the hands of law enforcement, everyday digital business practices become weapons of surveillance. I believe the FTC should intervene against the sale of consumer data to law enforcement and intelligence agencies.",,,,,,,

In addition to the Section 5 of the FTC Act. which prohibits unfair or deceptive practices including the sale or use of – for example – racially biased algorithms. The FTC could establish a AI Ethics Advisory Commission with the express purpose of overseeing AI in healthcare. This commission could assist in analyzing and resolving general ethical AI problems that arise at the individual, interpersonal, group, institutional, and society levels. 
Additionally, I believe that compliance is required but yet insufficient to guide the advancement of AI in the healthcare industry as the regulations should not only outline what is socially unacceptable but also what is socially preferable. It could concentrate on the goals and duties of various agents in the AI for healthcare system (such as clinicians, developers, and policymakers), as well as the effects that these agents' activities will have on the broader population.

There is urgency of empowering consumers with easy and clear ways to own their data and understand the usage and risks, but also for small business owners there are huge benefits on regulating the accessibility and usability of data. 

From consumers perspective: Data flow has been an opportunity and a threat for consumers, so  legislation around this needs to balance these two aspects. Opportunities exists when diverse and minority consumers can show their power through digital interactions, accessing data, brands realized the power this previously unseen consumers have. That is important to highlight as limitation on data can generate direct impact on the good and services minorities and remote communities will get access to. 
However, there is a threat when consumers cannot understand how their data is used and how it can effect them. I urge the Federal Trade Commission to create mechanism to empower consumers to educate, own and manage their own data and also own the economic rights of its commercialization. It is not fair that third parties benefits economically of data generated by consumers. 



From Small business owners perspective: Currently the power to capture, process and benefit for data is mostly fro large corporations with tech capabilities and resources to consume data. However, as owner of a small business focus on data analytics, I can talk about the benefits small and mid size companies can get from data to compete and grow. Accessing data (not personal data), but trends, consumption, geolocation or publicly available data, business owners can be more efficient in allocating their resources, can generate growth as they can offer their services to consumers all over the country which wasn't an option before. 
Data equips small and midsized business with the information needed to make better decisions, which in the past was exclusively to large corporations.
 
It is not a secret, tools like Google Ads and Facebook Ads have allowed small business grow sales. I don't mean there is not need to regulate, but I encourage the Commission to pay deep attention to the effects regulation will have in small and mid sized business owners, as they will be the ones with lack of technical capabilities and resources to switch to new technologies.

However, freedom does not equal invading other privacy or disrupting security, something which lots of people here misunderstood. The US is in dire need for security measures on cyber matters to combat domestic cyber-crime nowadays. I support such regulations to be implemented nationwide like GDPR in Europe and PDPA in Thailand so that crime against data and cyberworld would not go unpunished in the long run.

Privacy vs Security is one of the longest debates in human society. The more security, likely the less privacy, and also the other way around. Both points are very important but it is the balance between both that creates an ideal society for everyone. This applies to the trading field too because building security sacrifices some privacy as well. I think that people with privacy insecurity should learn to understand that the policy is for their sake and also it is important that concerned personnel communicate this.

	Moreover, I think that regulations should be applied to alternative categories as well, such as social media. We’ve been reported numerous times how social media exploited our private data for their personal uses. These invade our privacy and create no security, instead mostly harm, to the consumers. If nationwide regulations were to be established, it should take actions against this matter as well so that youth and their customers don’t fall victims to exploitation of data in everyday life.",,,,,,,

Customers have their rights to know what companies are collecting, and they have choice weather to use their service.
I recommend that the data collected by the companies should be regulated.  There should be some regulations clearly define what kind of information is not allowing to be collected for some companies.  Also, companies should make a very clear and simple UI to tell the user what information is being collected and do they have permission to use or share them, not in a very long and difficult reading privacy book that controls by a simple “I understand” button.

The Commission's goal should be to, prioritize the privacy of consumers over the profit of companies. Commercial surveillance, data gathering and sharing,  are extremely harmful and could potentially violate the customers rights. Consumer output policies would not work, because these policies are not seen as important as if they were rules set by the commission, which is why the commission needs to implement these rules. The rules should be strict, so that the biggest companies will deem it necessary to follow these rules. By limit advertising all together, and make privacy violations such a struggle to large companies it will cost them an incentive if they wish to violate these rules. This will affect their bottom lines and hopefully put an end to the violation of privacy rights, so many companies commit. The goal of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is to ensure the privacy of the consumer is being safely stored and legally distributed with no harm to the privacy of that person. Companies fail to uphold the regulations, therefore, there is a constant struggle with keeping private data off of the internet. ",,,,,,,

Corporations are preying on and exploiting people by anonymously and automatically collecting, then using and selling, personal data for their gain. The harms caused by widespread, unregulated corporate surveillance and data abuses pose a direct threat to the public at large, to our individual privacy and to the bedrock of our democracy. Current data practices amplify inequities stemming from systemic and historic discrimination. It disproportionately discriminates against people of color, women, members of the LGBTQ+ community, religious minorities, persons with disabilities, economically disadvantaged, immigrants and other marginalized groups. Now, in our post-Roe world, these threats have become more significant for women and their partners. These widespread harms directly result from the unfair and deceptive mass collection, use, and sharing of peoples’ data.

The FTC must enact rules requiring at a minimum an ""opt-in"" environment:  corporations and organizations must announce their REQUEST to collect any personal data, that the default is not to collect any personal data, and provide - in clear, simple language - options for users to select to allow the collection of any personal data.

I fully support the FTC in exercising the full extent of its authority to address the entire life cycle of data—collection, use, management, retention, and deletion—in order to provide people with significant protection from being exploited and invaded for corporate gain.  Areas where the FTC must provide clear rules include:
- Commercial surveillance technologies - The unprecedented amounts of data swept up en masse by private surveillance networks give corporations the information necessary to feed development of new products and adopt manipulative marketing techniques without any respect for privacy or even the illusion that people could opt in or out of the system. This surveillance has led to the most intimate details of our lives being monetized and our daily whereabouts tracked. 
- ""Accept All"" and ""Opt-Out"" practices: We must dispose of the false premise that “accept all'' policies are in any way a sign of meaningful or informed consent. Companies draft privacy language that the majority of the public are unable to read and understand. Meanwhile, the data collected by a company doesn’t always stay with that entity, as companies profit off the sharing of individuals’ data with third-party data brokers.  To address issues with data collection, the FTC should impose strict data minimization obligations on companies and ensure that individuals retain maximal control over their own personal data. At a minimum, the FTC must require and enforce ""opt-in"" rather than ""opt-out"" defaults.
- Data security: After a private entity has received permission to and collected consumer data, the onus must be on that company to take meaningful steps to ensure the security of that data. The FTC must require all internet enabled consumer products to employ end-to-end encryption by default. The FTC should also require companies to regularly perform data privacy audits to ensure accountability for data security and transparency around breaches and company practices. 

The FTC must use its full authority to not only address issues that are prevalent at present, but to proactively protect users in the future as technology and commercial surveillance practices evolve.  I thank the FTC for launching this rulemaking process and support its efforts to address the harms of current surveillance and abusive data practices.",,,,,,,

Facial recognition is something that is widely used and has already been the topic of plenty of debate due to problems such as the inherent bias that can be found when it is used. It has on multiple occasions misclassified, missed, or incorrectly read the faces of different people. There was an occasion in which a Chinese woman’s colleague, who is not related to her, was able to unlock her phone using Face ID (1). There have also been occasions where black men have been labeled as “animal”, “ape”, “gorilla” (2). These facial recognition tools can not accurately identify faces of minorities more often than not, and yet are being trusted in many facets of society as a form of identification and security. Airports use facial recognition, police identify suspects with it, and there are other applications not listed here. I think it is also important to note that companies use facial recognition within their services and collect this biometric data, which is unique to individuals, and use it without permission or notification to the people it has been taken from. A perfect example would be Facebook. In recent years, Facebook faced a lawsuit in Illinois for the misuse of facial data collected, along with others, violating the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act(BIPA) (3). Unlike other facets of security or private information, such as passwords or bank account information, your face is not something that can simply be changed. Facial recognition technology is something that should be more heavily restricted. There are many pros to such technology and it has been used successfully in the past, but that does not outweigh the risks of the wrongs that can be committed due to issues with facial recognition technology. Laws such as BIPA should be more widespread and more carefully thought out and enforced. While BIPA and other restrictions exist, it has been found that many of them are easily circumnavigated. Police have found ways to get around restrictions on them using facial recognition in multiple different states (4). It is necessary to examine things more carefully and better regulate and enforce restrictions on facial recognition.

In the age of the internet, many are facing the issue of data privacy. Among them, children are the most vulnerable. Child surveillance and data privacy of children are big issues as they can be easily exploited.
Without proper regulations and laws, it is hard to keep private companies and government agencies in check regarding children's privacy. Therefore, it is important to bring new rules and regulations to keep children safe online.
  A law that implements privacy as an important feature in design for companies while establishing a website that targets children or is used by children in any way and makes sure that the data they are collecting is minimal and only useful for the product.

We're forced to either accept a company's terms of service, which violate many people's standards for personal privacy, or do without the service and become unable to fully participate in today's economy. It has reached a point in the United States of America where accessing internet services, whether the services charge a fee or not, is no longer a luxury; it is a necessity for the majority of Americans. If companies want to do business in the United States, they need to do more to protect consumer privacy and respect consumer rights. The history of this country is rife with instances where unscrupulous companies ignored public outcry and continued to abuse the customer base that drives the economy. Companies that operate on the internet have been given enough time and enough warning to change their practices to better serve the American people. And if these internet companies think that they're too big and the American people are too dependent on them to be held accountable, then it's up to the American people, through their elected officials, to set the rules under which today's tech companies operate. I urge the FTC to enact regulations that would protect the American consumer and give this country's citizens control over their privacy again.",,,,,,,

Barring a refusal to use technology, consumers currently face little choice but to sign away their Fourth Amendment rights when they agree to data harvesting in the terms and conditions. This coercive practice circumvents users’ constitutional right to freedom from unreasonable searches, creating a loophole law enforcement routinely exploits to avoid the requirement to obtain a search warrant. 

While courts have long acknowledged that Fourth Amendment protections extend beyond physical space into the digital realm, the supposedly voluntary nature of data disclosures circumvents constitutional safeguards. By allowing the sale of user data, privacy law allows law enforcement to buy their way around the Fourth Amendment unhindered. The Fourth Amendment provides vital protections against the targeting of people based on race, religion, or ideology. The lack of clear constraints on surveillance powers raises the specter of racial, religious, and political profiling. Clearly, constitutional safeguards have not translated effectively into the digital age.

In the hands of law enforcement, everyday digital business practices become weapons of surveillance. Third-party data brokers market data culled from thousands of apps to law enforcement and federal intelligence agencies, subjecting millions of Americans to intrusive surveillance without the protections afforded by search warrant requirements. For these reasons, I believe the FTC should intervene against the sale of consumer data to law enforcement and intelligence agencies.

Let's go a step further. Surveillance tools are being used to target individuals for business purposes. Cell site simulators can be used to harvest all personal and private conversations. Is there a way to prevent the data from being used in fraudulent negotiations or from being used to commit and conceal criminal activity? 
The sale of commercial data is important, but it is not most important. As a society, we should be having discussions about the use of these tools and the unintended impacts of their use upon society. When the use of cell site simulators become more widespread, who will you do business with? Will you sell your house with the local flying realtor/FBI agent, who incidently is the buyer's agent? Will you go to the dentist if your relationship with the dentist is compromised by a third party interest? Would you start a business? I need not go on. When there is no trust, commerce stops.

However, freedom does not equal invading other privacy or disrupting security, something which lots of people here misunderstood. The US is in dire need for security measures on cyber matters to combat domestic cyber-crime nowadays. I support such regulations to be implemented nationwide like GDPR in Europe and PDPA in Thailand so that crime against data and cyberworld would not go unpunished in the long run.

Privacy vs Security is one of the longest debates in human society. The more security, likely the less privacy, and also the other way around. Both points are very important but it is the balance between both that creates an ideal society for everyone. This applies to the trading field too because building security sacrifices some privacy as well. I think that people with privacy insecurity should learn to understand that the policy is for their sake and also it is important that concerned personnel communicate this.

	Moreover, I think that regulations should be applied to alternative categories as well, such as social media. We’ve been reported numerous times how social media exploited our private data for their personal uses. These invade our privacy and create no security, instead mostly harm, to the consumers. If nationwide regulations were to be established, it should take actions against this matter as well so that youth and their customers don’t fall victims to exploitation of data in everyday life.

Big Tech gathers up huge amounts of data, inflicting harm, especially to the most society's mot vulnerable such as people of color, members of the LGBTQ community and children. HFTC should immediately:

-Impose substantial limits on commercial surveillance, including banning the use, sale and dissemination of facial recognition technology and giving users full control over their personal information like image, voice and location.
-Enforce the principle of data minimization. Companies use underhand techniques to collect data and then share it with third parties, as well as using it to predict personal behavior and inferring identity. The FTC must impose strict data minimization rules to stop these abusive data practices.
-Protect consumer data. The FTC must require all internet enabled consumer products to employ end-to-end encryption by default. The FTC should also require companies to regularly perform data privacy, civil rights impact audits.

I'm tired of being run over roughshod by these huge tech bullies when I must use the internet. It's gotten so bad, I try to avoid the internet when possible. My own personal data has been released several times by huge companies. Now I must use monitoring services and keep my credit frozen.

Data localization laws are regulations that require that data generated in a country remains within the country, i.e., 1) It is stored on servers that are physically located within the country, 2) Data processing and derivative use of the data remains within the country. The proponents of data localization laws generally provide the following reasons in support of data localization: 1) Safeguarding external and internal security, 2) Ensuring privacy, and 3) Opportunities of digital economy for citizens. There are several costs/harms associated with implementation of data localization laws such as- Blocking the advantages of cloud computing, Stifling innovation, Slowing the Digital Ecosystem and Undermining Trade and Economic Growth, and Undermining Fraud Prevention and Cyber Security Best Practices.

Data economics misconceptions may lead to inaccurate policy considerations. Data is the new oil has been a well-known catchphrase that has been in media outlets all over the world for years. This comparison was a reasonable attempt to explain the potential worth of a new resource and the crucial part it would play in sustaining the next wave of innovation and the world economy. Unfortunately, it might also have contributed to a faulty view of how to handle this resource in a way that would benefit a nation and its people. Data storage inside national borders won't increase its value or stimulate local economies. When data can be used across organizations, industries, and borders with confidence and consent, its value is maximized. Hence, in my opinion there should not be regulation restricting data flows across countries.

New legal and economic frameworks to enable trusted and permissioned flow of data across borders that ensure safety, security, and equal access opportunity, are a much better solution to the issues driving data localization. This should be the goal of data policy. Below is a list of a few precedents: 

 1) The Osaka Track was launched by the Japanese G20 Presidency in 2019 to support efforts to develop global rules for Data Free Flow with Trust (DFFT). It described a data governance architecture that offers guidelines for international standards.

2) In the absence of global frameworks, forward looking bilateral trade agreements have begun addressing digital trade, the flow of data, protection, privacy, and new standards for digital identity and records. The most sophisticated example of these accords is the Digital Economy Agreement (DEA) between Australia and Singapore, which was signed in August 2020. This agreement provides a great framework for bilateral initiatives and outlines the key topics for conversations concerning international standards.

New technology in digital identity and data tracing are poised to play an important role. Technology professionals and business are collaborating in forums like the Open ID Foundation, IIF Open Digital Trust initiative, and The Trust over IP (ToIP) Foundation to create new open standards for the secure sharing of data.

Recent case studies showed that some companies with their web tracking bots are tracking health information, medical information from hospital sites, and some companies trading insurance and children's health data of the users. Having this data will be a competitive advantage for companies for target advertising. Taking into the personal, identity, insurance, and banking details of users imposes potential risks on the users. To reduce the risk to health care users, companies should collect minimal information which is indeed useful rather than collecting personal information related to identity.

The Open Voice Network is a non-profit, technology-neutral project of The Linux Foundation working in the realm of artificial intelligence-enabled conversational assistance (“voice”) technology.  As a technology-neutral, nonprofit organization, the Open Voice Network occupies a unique and strategic position within the voice technology industry. Should the Federal Trade Commission determine that new trade regulation rules or other regulatory alternatives concerning the collection and treatment of consumer data are needed, recent Open Voice Network research would encourage and support the inclusion of voice technology within such rules.

Corporations have more personal information about me than the NSA, and fewer restrictions on its use. They can and do use that information to its personal gain, both to manipulate me monetarily, to alter my political decisions, and can sell the information they've collected to others to do the same. Companies even run studies on their users without their knowledge or informed consent, such as when Facebook attempted to induce depression in users via feed curation. 
This is a violation of my privacy and security. 

And beyond that? What I do is my business. It is illegal for a company to riffle through my mail and check what I've ordered so they may better sell to me. Yet that very act is common--standard--for email, search history, locations, etc, in an era when most people do more online than by mail. 
Please implement restrictions on commercial surveillance and data brokering--no surveillance of individual actions, no logging or sale of data. Companies advertise to general audiences on TV, radio, magazines, etc; they are capable of adverts without knowing my age, political opinions, location, education level, and health history. In practice, they may shift to a 'more like this' model, where they place ads based on the content of a page, instead of who's viewing it (like google's search result ads)
Please implement fines, which are sufficiently putative to disincentivize the practice and allow good actors to remain competitive. Please implement restrictions, preventing corporations knowing 

74. In which circumstances, if any, is consumer consent likely to be effective? Which factors, if any, determine whether consumer consent is effective? 
76. To what extent should new trade regulation rules prohibit certain specific commercial surveillance practices, irrespective of whether consumers consent to them? 
Consent only matters if it's an option, if you can say no. If I reject all cookies on spotify, the site does not work. I cannot use Facebook without being tracked and potentially experimented on--it's explicitly in the terms of service(TOS). Additionally, very, very few people read the TOS. Consumers automatically hit 'agree', unaware of its contents. Whatever they consent to is not informed consent. If their consent is to be at all meaningful, it must 
a) not be crucial for the performance of the service
b) be specifically sought and agreed to
c) not agreed to as part of a bundle
d) probably come with a bright red pop up saying ""This means [company] can track you and sell your data, do you want that? Y/N"" in plain, non lawyerese
IF it is allowed, it should be a toggle in settings, not a TOS we see once that people don't read.

Thank you.",,,,,,,

There is ABSOLUTELY no reason why an online vendor should be able to access this info (and much more) if I buy exactly the same book from Amazon or Barnes & Noble or the like.  Every browser I use is tricked out with multiple extensions to try to block or limit tracking.  

Because I care so much about data privacy, I probably end up spending about 20% more time online trying to figure out how few domains I can allow javascript on, and how much tracking I can block, while still being able to do what I need to do.

Hearing about the potentially serious harms from social manipulation really ignited my interest in privacy and from that point on, I have dedicated a large part of my time and skills to protecting privacy.

There are so many things I could talk about, but I have decided to focus my comment on one foundational and critical issue. As Internet users move increasingly from web browsers to mobile apps, they are at a substantially increased risk of harm. Mobile devices have access to troves of personal data (location, contacts, etc.) and, at the same time, mobile platforms actively disable capabilities that are needed for privacy preserving tools.
I urge the commission to explore mechanisms for requiring the two main mobile platforms, iOS and Android, to allow installation and trust of user certificates in order to increase transparency and simplify third-party audits. Furthermore, the platforms should provide ways for researchers and auditors to disable certificate pinning.

Mobile app usage is incredibly prevalent with mobile apps overtaking browsers in Internet usage since 2014 [2]. Unfortunately, while browser users can utilize alternative, privacy-preserving browsers or install third-party extensions to gain visibility into and control over web traffic even if encryption is used, mobile app users cannot. Prior to the release of Android 7 in 2016, it was possible to install trusted user certificates on the device and inspect TLS traffic to gain some visibility. Tools such as AntMonitor [3] used this capability to detect exposure of personally identifiable information and allowed users to block such exposure. However, as the ""game of escalation"" went on and Android 7 was released, it became impossible to build tools for transparency and privacy protection on non-rooted devices. Similarly, iOS does not allow to install and trust self-signed certificates, limiting transparency to jailbroken devices only.
It is disturbing to me that mobile platforms are increasingly introducing limitations that block privacy audits and privacy preserving tools. Users repeatedly and clearly demonstrate their desire to preserve their privacy, but as mechanisms to do so are introduced, mobile platforms adapt to make this harder. This game of escalation with platforms is an example of the persistent attempt to overcome users' legitimate desire to inspect the mobile ecosystem and protect their privacy.

It would be great if our government could enforce more transparency in the mobile ecosystem.

I.	My Perspective on Consumer Data Privacy    

As a 29-year-old woman and CUNY Law student, I am writing in general support of your agency’s Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“ANPR”) to regulate commercial surveillance and data security. As much as I hate to admit it, the first thing I do when I wake up is grab my iPhone and look at an array of social media apps; the last thing I do before I go to sleep is set my alarm for the next day on my phone. I am completely open with the unfortunate fact that I, like most of my “Millennial” generation and the “Gen Z” generation below us, am completely addicted to and 100% fully reliant on my phone. Accordingly, I applaud the FTC in issuing this regulation to move the United States into the 21st century by joining countries across the globe in regulating consumer data privacy. 

II.	Commercial Data Surveillance Has Undoubtedly Harmed Consumers

In response to this ANPR, I want to focus on responding to question number 4 regarding how these commercial surveillance practices harm consumers or increase the risk of harm to consumers. Beyond the quotidian phone addiction that I have already mentioned, I question how these commercial surveillance practices have *not* harmed consumers—ranging from their inevitable toll on mental health[1],  to the racism perpetuated through mechanisms like facial recognition surveillance technology[2],  to issues that the FTC itself has expressed the intention of regulating like algorithmic bias in “automated decision-making tools in consumer-facing decisions.”[3]  As someone who initially grew up without a phone and limited access to a computer and has now fully transitioned into constant use of technology and therefore hourly personal data transmission, it is honestly difficult to formulate a concise response to this question.

III.	Bodily Autonomy Must Be Protected

However, particularly given the context of the recent undoing of Roe v. Wade, an issue that is especially front of mind at the moment is the weaponization of menstrual cycle tracking apps to track and criminalize people seeking abortion care. Cases like that of Latice Fisher in Mississippi,[4]  who was prosecuted for having an abortion based entirely on evidence of her alleged internet search history regarding how to induce a miscarriage and how to purchase misoprostol is viewed as becoming “standard protocol across the country” now that the Supreme Court has opened the door to states criminalizing abortion once again.[5] Another case in Indiana prosecuted Purvi Patel for merely texting her friend about taking abortion pills late in a pregnancy[6]—although Patel was able to successfully appeal this case, it is egregious that pregnant people are not able to even communicate with their loved ones about such a personal health decision without these private conversations being weaponized against them by law enforcement.[7]  Even the traditionally sacrosanct health privacy regulation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) can be superseded by a law enforcement official obtaining a subpoena or court order requiring a company to supply specific data—a concept rendered all the more disturbing by states like Texas and Oklahoma rewarding “bounty hunters” who bring successful lawsuits against anyone they allege has aided an abortion.[8]  
	In closing, I write this comment to strongly encourage the FTC to prioritize protecting people’s bodily autonomy against the incessant data surveillance and tracking that we are all exposed to on an hourly basis. Deciding what to do with your own body should not be an arena that private companies get to oversee; how people prioritize their own health and life decisions should not be at the mercy of companies to weaponize however they see fit or in whatever way they deem the most profitable. In light of these concerns, I sincerely hope that the FTC will view people’s right to their own bodily autonomy as a crucial liberty to be protected in its future Notice of Proposed Rulemaking by prioritizing the regulation of consumer data tracking these deeply intimate health decisions.

Thank you for your consideration,

I am here to demand that all commercial surveillance be thoroughly and immediately criminalized to the fullest degree.

This is not only my opinion, it was also the conclusion of Forbrukerradet, the Norwegian equivalent of the American FTC, which called for a full ban of commercial surveillance for the purposes of advertising.

They recently released two English-language reports which I encourage you to read, one titled _Out of Control_ and another titled _Time to Ban Surveillance Advertising_, the findings of which were that commercial surveillance is a tremendous harm to society and provides a net negative benefit to the economy. 

These are three of the many harmful effects listed in that report which I'd like to highlight:

1. Manipulation
	The fundamental purpose of commercial surveillance is to manipulate behavior, a violation of our right to live freely without interference. This manipulation affects all of us, but the harm multiplies with vulnerability. As one of countless examples, online casinos were found to routinely target those with prior gambling addictions.

2. Discrimination
  Segmentation of people by race, class and other protected status - either directly or by proxy - is a key capability offered by ad targeting vendors and is routinely used for discriminatory targeting of consumers. As an example, Facebook recently paid a fine of only $100,000 for facilitating race-based housing discrimination, which amounts to less than one minute of their revenue. 

3. Erosion of Social Trust
  At the end of the day, everybody knows this is creepy and doesn't like it. We all  feel spied upon and we all feel tricked. This undermines fundamental trust in government, in business and in society at large. There are no tangible benefits to the public and only benefits to parasitic companies, many of which are benefiting from large scale fraud. Society would be more free and more happy if commercial surveillance was criminalized. If the practices that these companies routinely engage in were done by ordinary people, they would meet the criteria for criminal stalking and harassment.

I know from having worked in this industry for nearly two decades that wherever people's data can be exploited for profit, it will be, and then that exploitation will be lied about by industry representatives who use weasel-words like, ""pro-ecosystem"", ""diversity of choice"" and ""enhance the end-user experience"".

The industry has shown absolutely no ability to regulate itself, as shown by the fact that many of the other speakers have been working as consumer advocates in this field for more than 20 years. The cost of fines is minuscule compared to by the profits to be made by violating regulations. The only way this exploitation will stop is through criminalization.

Finally, I strongly encourage anybody involved in this decision making process to recuse themselves if they hold any stock in these advertising companies, including in ETFs.",,,,,,,

Clean Up Gambling welcomes this opportunity to contribute to the Federal Trade Commission’s proposed rulemaking relating to Commercial Surveillance and Data Security. Clean Up Gambling has uploaded submissions which provide evidence and analysis concerning the unfair and deceptive practices embodied in the particularly injurious form of commercial surveillance conducted by the online betting and gaming industry. Clean Up Gambling has led the way in uncovering such practices, through our own work and through commissioned expert analyses. Those expert analyses include an (i) in-depth investigation by independent experts, Cracked Labs, into the data flows occurring as a consequence of commercial surveillance in the online gambling industry and (ii) a detailed review of the legality of such practices in the UK and Europe. 
2.            While Clean Up Gambling is based in the UK, our insights and experience are salient to the proposed rules that the FTC may make given the wider US context that many US states are opening their market to online gambling operators. The evidence Clean Up Gambling has uncovered reflects the FTC’s concerns about “Sophisticated digital advertising systems [that] automate the targeting of … services to the most vulnerable consumers.” When those systems are deployed in an online gambling context, they have harmful consequences for consumers including individual financial ruin, psychological distress and beyond.
3.            By design of the platforms, consumers cannot know the full extent of processing conducted by remote gambling operators, nor understand the consequences of their profiling, such that the processing is invisible. Nor is it possible to know all the entities that process individuals’ personal data on the instructions of gambling operators. Indeed, despite engaging technical experts over a months-long investigation, even CUG were unable to determine the full extent of the profiling.
4.            The analysis nevertheless suggested that the use of personal data for commercial surveillance by the industry breached the legal regulations on the use of personal information in the UK. Clean Up Gambling accordingly instructed AWO, the leading data rights agency, to conduct a legal analysis of the evidence that was found from the investigation by Cracked Labs. That legal analysis resulted in submissions to the regulator of personal information in the UK, the Information Commissioner’s Office. Those submissions set out widespread and systemic breaches of the data protection regulation, including issues relating to consent, transparency and failure to provide agency for individuals to exercise their rights.
5.            This surveillance is powerful; it allows gambling operators to make commercially important inferences about their customers and personalise their experience of gambling platforms as a result, thereby maximising the amount of time and money spent remote gambling – even with the attendant risk of compulsive behaviour and addiction.",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/FTC-2022-0053-0735/attachment_2.pdf,https://downloads.regulations.gov/FTC-2022-0053-0735/attachment_3.pdf,https://downloads.regulations.gov/FTC-2022-0053-0735/attachment_4.pdf,https://downloads.regulations.gov/FTC-2022-0053-0735/attachment_1.pdf",

Those who are undocumented, those who stand up to large corporations, or those who engage in forms of work that are not legally recognized could face further financial exclusion, difficulties in renting an apartment or finding a job, or increased on-line or in-person harassment. For example, payment processors such as PayPal and Venmo are known to have shut down the accounts of people believed to be engaged in sex work (https://www.aclu.org/news/lgbtq-rights/paypal-and-venmo-are-shutting-out-sex-workers-putting-lives-and-livelihoods-at-risk). If PayPal or Venmo then shares the information they have with other banks or payment processors, it is possible that those individuals could be shut out from all forms of financial institutions. Where would they be expected to keep their money then?

There is also the egregious example of legal databases like LexisNexis selling data to enforcement and deportation agencies like ICE (https://theintercept.com/2021/04/02/ice-database-surveillance-lexisnexis/). LexisNexis collects and sells highly personal information like home addresses, Social Security Numbers, and rentals histories. Companies buying that information can use it to restrict who can open a bank account or rent an apartment or receive healthcare. Someone who is undocumented and already facing threats from ICE (which this Commission can unfortunately do nothing about) could also face increased restrictions on literally every other aspect of life if their data is allowed to be bought by other companies with no regard for protection or safeguarding. 

In addition to private companies partaking in the buying and selling of personal data, the government also produces and shares data that needs to be safeguarded (and, most likely, should not even be collected in the first place). While this may not be under the purview of the Commission, the National Security Agency, the Census, and the IRS collect highly sensitive data on all of us (https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/11/Pew-Research-Center_PI_2019.11.15_Privacy_FINAL.pdf). For example, the NSA records “the metadata for nearly all telephone calls made in the U.S.” (https://www.propublica.org/article/nsa-data-collection-faq). It is easy to imagine that if companies got a hold of the information contained within the “No Fly List”, a database maintained by the FBI’s Terrorist Screening Center, they could target those on the list by denying them access to services or putting them in further harm’s way by subjecting them to increased surveillance. 

For companies collecting, selling, and buying data, our personal data is the newest frontier that they are able to endlessly exploit and profit off of. Before, the capitalist class had to exploit physical and personal resources, i.e., land, natural resources, and human labor. However, those resources were finite – there is only so much land that can be conquered until all the land is officially colonized. On the other hand, our personal data is a limitless, infinite source of profit for them because we are constantly creating new data points. As such, the regulation of data collection, buying, and selling needs to be thorough and strict in an attempt to reign in these capitalist profiteers. 

Regarding Q43 in particular, companies are going to want to take the least costly and least burdensome route regarding data security. However, companies need to be made to think of data security as an integral part of their business that requires constant attention and resources. When starting a business or expanding a business, compliance with strict data security regulations should be part of what companies must consider and account for. Ideally, the new regulations will impose limitations that clearly define what companies are and are not allowed to collect, use, and share. The collected data should only entail data necessary for a specific purpose, any non-essential or secondary data collection should not be allowed. 

While it is an enormous amount of work for the Commission to “discern which data are relevant to achieving certain purposes and no more,” this is exactly what the Commission needs to do. This task will only continue to grow as companies expand into collecting more and more data. By laying down a solid foundation that is sector-specific, comprehensive, but also adjustable, the Commission can ensure that these data protocols are implementable right now and can be tweaked as necessary as new frontiers in technology – and subsequently in data collection – are reached.

	As a citizen concerned with commercial surveillance, and the unauthorized use of data privacy, I am writing to express my support for regulating the ways in which companies use, share, sell, consumer data, and monetize that data in ways that are unfair or deceptive. Companies for far too long have gotten away with using their user's data in any way they see fit, oftentimes selling that data to unknown sources, unbeknownst to the user, and at the expense of the user. The FTC has a long history of enforcing actions that concern data privacy and security. They have a long history of policy work and advocating for the rights of consumers and the right to data privacy in terms of collecting private health-related data by parties, posting of private health-related data online, and selling of sensitive data like social security numbers to third parties. As well as taking actions against other forms of data privacy breaches like “revenge porn”, and inaccurate tenant screenings. The FTC has been at the forefront of all these issues and now tackles the issue of commercial surveillance and the damage it is doing to users. Commercial surveillance is used by big companies in order to monetize and profit from users' data. These big companies are using and selling this data in order to maximize profit and are willing to monitor a user's every move in order to sell it and make a profit. By doing this, these companies are allowing users' data to go to third parties, and to be sold off without their knowledge or permission. This data can be later used by other entities and be used for nefarious purposes, and the fact that companies know this is an issue, and use deceptive tactics in order to get users' data, is plainly wrong. 
The question I will address concerns the harms that consumers may not easily discern or identify. This question focuses on the extent of the harm commercial surveillance and/or lax security measures have on consumers. First, consumers in general may not be aware of what they are agreeing to when they sign off on companies being able to use their data. Many consumers are not in line with technology as a whole, and in a highly digitalized world, many consumers are unaware of just how much data is being given to third parties, sold off to other companies, and with the system that is in place now, many of them will continue to be unaware that their every move is being digitized, profited off, and sold to other companies. Furthermore, companies can have a full user profile based on the data stolen from consumers. The problem with this is a lack of accountability and the effect it can have on consumers' lives, based on data they had no idea was being collected and sold off to other parties. This mass collection effort can also lead to loss of data, many consumers run the risk of having sensitive information stolen off of companies that they were not even aware had the data to begin with. This poses a national security threat as well since companies are handling massive data of individual consumers and can be subject to data breach attacks by sources outside of the country, or in other regions of the world. Hackers can also steal this data, and if it's sensitive data like a social security number, they can attack consumers and demand money in order to have their information back. 
Finally, on a more human level, in a democracy, people should have the right to know that their data is being collected and monetized and have the right to opt out of this collection of consumer data. The whole region of consumer data collection has a money-first perspective to it, and companies seem to not care about their consumer's data as long as they are able to profit from it. By raising concerns over the lax security these companies are employing, the FTC is letting people know that their data is at risk of being stolen or used for other purposes than the ones not even intended but known by the consumer. Consumers deserve privacy online, and the FTC must protect them against unauthorized use or coerced use of their personal data. 
In conclusion,  I support the FTC cracking down on commercial surveillance and lax security and they must come up with a solution to solve the data privacy problem. Companies will continue to take advantage of consumers and continue to exploit their data for personal gain. Congress and the Commission cannot sit by and let millions of consumers data be used, for the most part without their consent, knowledge, or intent. The ramifications of allowing companies to continue to use this data unchecked will be felt by generations to come, if the commission does not act soon, the data privacy of millions will continue to be exposed to many harms. Data privacy continues to be the most pressing privacy concern facing Americans today, and as the world keeps getting more and more digitized, congress, the commission, someone must act and protect consumer rights.

The Information Accountability Foundation (“IAF”) is pleased to submit comments on the Federal Trade Commission Advanced Notice of Proposed Rule Making on Surveillance Capitalism and Security (ANPR).  Our full comments are submitted as an attachment. The IAF staff thinks it is time for the FTC to issue an unfairness rule on the fair processing of data pertaining to people.  However, that rule should be tailored to preventing a set of adverse processing impacts that are designated in the rule.  The comments reflect the views of the IAF staff and not necessarily those of the IAF Board or members.   
Data minimization and purpose limitations are broad concepts, and, as defined by the FTC, so is corporate surveillance.  The attached comments address those key concepts in greater detail.  Bright-line rules based on broad concepts are very tantalizing, and they should be very rare.   An example of a bright-line rule is found in the 1992 FTC consent orders with TRW Information Systems & Services and Equifax that established that any combination of tradeline information and identifying information from a consumer reporting agency was a consumer report.  This was a privacy case that essentially outlawed a marketing support service called reverse bank card append.  Since 1992 such bright-line privacy cases that outlaw a line of commerce have been few and far between.  
Appropriate data use is very context driven and needs to be assessed in context. That is why privacy laws in Virginia, Colorado and Connecticut require risky processing be assessed for harm to individuals, groups, and society at large.  That is why the IAF continually defaults to risk assessments measured against a yardstick of adverse processing impacts in its model legislation, THE FAIR and OPEN USE ACT, and is a key point in the IAF’s comments on the ANPR.  
There has been criticism that the ANPR is too broad.  Given the nature of a digital society, the breadth of questions in the ANPR is respectful of the extent of the issues related to broad data collection/creation, transformation of data into information and knowledge, and then using that knowledge to create action.
In responding to the ANPR, the IAF relied on research conducted by IAF principals dating back to the early 2000’s.  Our comments contain links to that research.  The IAF’s comments addressed the difference between observation and commercial surveillance, the importance of accountability, and the need for a clear set of standards for people to assess risks and benefits against.  As mentioned above, the IAF also addressed the weakness associated with bright line principles, such as data minimization and purpose limitations, particularly as it relates to knowledge discovery (the use of data to create new insights).  
The IAF sees the ANPR as another milestone in establishing fair processing guidance for commerce in the United States.  The process would be useful even if Congress were to enact a new privacy law, because the research submitted would be applicable to any rulemaking required by a new law.  
As stated above, our full comments are the attachment below.

I hope this comment finds you well. I am writing to you from Long Island City, Queens, NY where I am a second-year law student at the City University of New York (“CUNY”) School of Law. I am writing this comment as a concerned Muslim-American citizen of color, who has data security concerns. 
The issue I am choosing to focus on explores how American Muslims are discriminated against through automated systems and unregulated data collection processes. The FTC has already pointed to data proving that automated systems used by firms to analyze data have learned to discriminate by gender, race, and housing status.  However, the FTC does not acknowledge the disparate impact of unfettered data surveillance on Muslims in a post-9/11 and USA PATRIOT Act America.

In 2020, it was revealed that the U.S. Special Operations Command was purchasing location data on Muslims from Muslim Pro, a prayer and Quran app that had more than 98 million downloads worldwide, a Craigslist app, a Muslim dating app, and others.  Location data collected by the software development kit (SDK) in the app was sold to a third-party company, X-Mode, who then sold the data to defense contractors and the U.S. military.  The data transfer included details like the precise geolocation coordinates of the phone’s current location, the name of the Wi-Fi network the phone was connected to, a timestamp, and the model of the phone the app was used on.  Muslim Pro did not mention X-Mode in its privacy policy or provide any pop-up notification that there would be a location data transfer to the U.S. military.  This is a clear example of deceiving consumers about how their data will be collected, used, or shared. People who use this app for prayer, unwittingly consented to having their location information shared with the U.S. military. This practice needs to be regulated by the FTC because it invades the privacy of millions of Americans in the country, with no repercussions. It allows for the continued surveillance of unsuspecting Muslims, under the guise of counterrorism and national security concerns, without informing civilians of this practice. This unregulated data collection continues the cycle of abridging the rights of American Muslims to assemble and practice religion without government interference. In fact, it does the opposite and allows the military to harvest data on innocent people through third parties. The FTC should use its authority to create transparency laws that companies must abide by when a consumer data transfer is in question and to provide protections to members of protected identities. 
To force the FTC into action, the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR) filed a complaint against the FTC on the issue of deceptive and warrantless surveillance of American-Muslims, limiting their First Amendment rights of freedom to practice religion and the right to assembly.   CAIR calls on the FTC to bring enforcement actions against deceptive and unfair actors in the location data industry. Specifically, CAIR calls for the FTC to conduct 6(b) investigations to determine which actors are harming consumers and releasing private data.  They argue that the FTC is uniquely positioned to create guardrails like mandating explicit opt-in consent from consumers, that will regulate profit-driven companies, who will not stop otherwise. This is because the FTC has the power to promulgate rules around unfair and deceptive practices that companies like X-Mode employ. CAIR has noted that Congress has recognized the FTC’s authority as a rulemaking body and called on the Commission to investigate privacy violations by companies selling private data.  CAIR calls on the FTC to initiate a rulemaking process to regulate mobile operating systems, advertising exchanges’ management, and location data, along with creating guidance that location data industry stakeholders can follow to avoid deceiving consumers. 

It is disappointing that the data privacy situation in our country is so dire, where millions of citizens have very little education on who is collecting their data, for what purpose, and where it is going. However, it is heartening to know that legal organizations like CAIR are looking out for American Muslims who are unjustly surveilled. Since 9/11, unsuspecting American Muslims have been targeted by unfounded counterterrorism efforts and policies. I am personally connected to this issue because my family, friends, and I all use Muslim Pro and I am left wondering if my data has been sold to the U.S. military, for no good or apparent reason. I did not consent to the sale of my geographic data, and I encourage the FTC to create guidance and rules to regulate the uncontrolled sale of private data through this rulemaking process.

I think any exception should not be just a vague exception, but should also provide practical guidance to lawyers as to how to conduct discovery while trying to keep data private.  Specifically, I believe the rules should specifically allow (but not require) the parties to produce documents to each other without redactions so long as they have a protective order that states the documents will not be used for any purpose other than the litigation at issue and that the documents will be deleted once the litigation is over. Redacting documents in litigation is a huge expense and it is difficult to get a team of reviewing attorneys on the same page about exactly what is and isn't PII.  If the producing party could be certain that they will not be punished for engaging in discovery without redacting PII, the costs associated with electronic discovery could be curtailed - at least on this issue.  The parties should still be allowed to decide that some data is so private that they WANT to redact it, but they would not be required to.  I think this is very important because while the privacy regulations that have come out so far are really designed for companies that collect and resell consumer data, the wording is so broad that they apply to most companies in a given region, whether they are actually reselling the data or not.  So having clear guidance on how to conduct discovery where PII is potentially involved will help all parties, not just those litigants specifically involved in a challenge regarding the handling of private data.",,,,,,,

I want to focus on reasons privacy is important, corresponding to questions 4, 5, and 6.
  
Without Privacy Democracy Fails
 
Easter Island turned from a a lush forest of 16 million palm trees to a barren landscape and was once considered a metaphor for unsustainable human activity.
 
More recent work suggests that invasive species of rats may have destroyed the island’s forests.  Rats can't eat massive palm trees—but they do love to eat seeds and sprouts.  And without new growth, in short order, there are no massive trees.  The entire ecology changed due to rats eating tiny sprouts.
 
Democracy and a free economy depend on new growth.  Every important idea starts as a vulnerable sprout.  And since important ideas typically disrupt, they adversely impact entrenched power. Obscurity provides the opportunity for sprouts to grow past vulnerability.  

Surveillance capitalism allows the powerful to see new growth as soon as it sprouts.  When it is killed this early, nobody even notices it existed.  What does somehow grow is easily crushed due to massive tool chest of information to discredit ""fringe"" opponents.
  
Without Privacy, Behavior Changes
 
People behave differently when watched--some would say for the better.  But is that really true?  
 
First, what we often talk about as “better” behavior is conforming behavior.  We work harder, cooperate more, follow the rules.  That’s great—in the short term.  But in the long-term it may not be so great.  This “good” behavior is often our least authentic self, and it is unsustainable.

Surveillance capitalism has other negative behavioral impacts.  There is a reason that grocery stores put certain “impulse buy” items at the checkout stand.  We grab there may not be our best decisions motivated by our fast thinking emotional “System 1” decision process.  Smart purchases do not need a lot of push advertising.  The easiest incremental purchases enabled by massive data + mining  are impulse purchases of questionable merit.  We now live in an endless checkout candy display with our choices steered on a downward trajectory.
 
The Destruction of Consumer Surplus
 
Personal data is used to determine how much to charge.  With many more parties taking a share of revenue the true price “discounts” available to consumers are likely decreasing.  Armies of data scientists work to figure out how to give you just enough off “full price” to take an offer, but absolutely no more than that.
 
There is a core economic concept called “consumer surplus” which is the difference between what a consumer is willing to pay and the price they pays. In a perfect market, this also represents the aggregate benefit consumers receive.  With corporate access to unprecedented levels of personal information, we are moving to a world where producers can customize prices more and more accurately to minimize consumer surplus, 

Your Friends, Neighbors and Relatives may Gain Access to Your Data

Before there was anything like today’s internet, I worked at a consumer lender corporation on the sales/customer service floor.  Many times I observed agents surreptitiously scouring the customer base for people they knew personally or searching for private histories on celebrities .  The company had a policy against this, and fired people who were caught but people still did it there, and at other companies .
 
The general public has a poor understanding of just how ubiquitous and revealing their personal data actually is.  Take something simple like data comprised of a series of “anonymous” locations.  It is amazing the stories this so-called “anonymous data” can reveal.  If you have individual level location data, the concept of “anonymous” is nonsense.  Someone with access to this information can easily identify your work and home locations.  If an individual regularly left their office during a workday and visited a motel for one hour, it wouldn’t be hard to surmise they might be having an affair. This sort of information can be highly valuable when obtained by employers, insurance companies, ex-spouses, and tech-savvy stalkers.   
 
The Death of Privacy is the Death of Consumer Power
 
Most of us have also dealt with companies where the only deterrent to them from pulling shenanigans is a cost/benefit analysis of consequences.  In those situations, power makes all the difference.

If you have a dispute your personal data is an extremely powerful asset to large corporations. They have the knowledge to mine it and lawyers who know how to turn it (and possibly distort it) into the story they want to tell, reducing consumer power.",,,,,,,

These motivational circuits operate largely below the level of consciousness, and the frontal circuits that are responsible for consciously choosing to resist such motivations are not fully developed in children and young adults. There is a strong case to be made that app designers are exploiting neural vulnerabilities in minors to increase use of their apps, and I believe action should be taken by the FTC to restrict these techniques.",,,,,,,

Reckless data practices replicate and amplify inequities stemming from systemic and historic discrimination. The harms caused by widespread, unregulated corporate surveillance and data abuses pose a direct threat to the public at large, and can disproportionately discriminate against people of color, women, members of the LGBTQ+ community, religious minorities, persons with disabilities, economically disadvantaged, immigrants and other marginalized groups. In our post-Roe world, these threats have become more significant for people who can get pregnant. These widespread harms directly result from the unfair and deceptive mass collection, use, and sharing of peoples’ data.
I fully support the FTC in exercizing the full extent of its authority to address the entire life cycle of data—collection, use, management, retention, and deletion—in order to provide people with significant protection from discrimination and related data harms. Here are some specific actions I urge the FTC to take:
- Commercial surveillance technologies: As surveillance devices flood the market, we’ve seen the installation of the largest private surveillance network in US history. Doorbell cameras, floodlight cameras, AI powered dash cameras, automated license plate readers, facial recognition and other tools of biometric surveillance give corporations roaming eyes in every neighborhood, shopping center, and street in our communities. It’s become nearly impossible to avoid being surveilled in daily life. The unprecedented amounts of data swept up en masse by private surveillance networks give corporations the information necessary to feed development of new products and adopt manipulative marketing techniques without any respect for privacy or even the illusion that people could opt in or out of the system. This surveillance has led to the most intimate details of our lives being monetized and our daily whereabouts tracked. Once companies have gathered this private, sensitive data, it becomes subject to misuse in ways users could never have anticipated. In response to the onslaught of surveillance technologies, the FTC must ban the use, sale, and dissemination of facial recognition technology, and institute human rights-based protections that give people full autonomy and control over their personal information and digital bodies, including image, voice, and whereabouts.
- Data minimization: We must dispose of the false premise that “accept all'' policies are in any way a sign of meaningful or informed consent. Companies draft privacy language that the majority of the public are unable to read and understand. Meanwhile, the data collected by a company doesn’t always stay with that entity, as companies profit off the sharing of individuals’ data with third-party data brokers. Not only do many people not realize this is a common practice, but it is also unlikely they could understand the potential impacts or how this data could be used as it changes hands. As this data is collected and merged, companies are able to predict personal behavior and infer ones' identity, despite industry claims of anonymity. The aggregation of this data allows private entities to conduct discriminatory prediction, which results in biased practices and policies that negatively impact marginalized and vulnerable communities. To address issues with data collection, the FTC should impose strict data minimization obligations on companies and ensure that individuals retain maximal control over their own personal data.
- Data security: After a private entity has collected consumer data, the onus must be on that company to take meaningful steps to ensure the security of that data. Endless examples of cyberattacks that have exposed peoples’ personal, biometric, financial, and other data highlight how the information companies collect is a target for hackers, data thieves, and other bad actors. In order to fully protect consumer data, the FTC must require all internet enabled consumer products to employ end-to-end encryption by default. The FTC should also require companies to regularly perform data privacy, civil rights impact audits to ensure accountability for data security and transparency around breaches and company practices. 
The FTC must use its full authority to not only address issues that are prevalent at present, but to proactively protect users in the future as technology and commercial surveillance practices evolve. I thank the FTC for launching this rulemaking process and support its efforts to address the harms of surveillance and data abuses.",,,,,,,

Reckless data practices replicate and amplify inequities stemming from systemic and historic discrimination. The harms caused by widespread, unregulated corporate surveillance and data abuses pose a direct threat to the public at large, and can disproportionately discriminate against people of color, women, members of the LGBTQ+ community, religious minorities, persons with disabilities, economically disadvantaged, immigrants and other marginalized groups. In our post-Roe world, these threats have become more significant for people who can get pregnant. These widespread harms directly result from the unfair and deceptive mass collection, use, and sharing of peoples’ data.
I fully support the FTC in exercizing the full extent of its authority to address the entire life cycle of data—collection, use, management, retention, and deletion—in order to provide people with significant protection from discrimination and related data harms. Here are some specific actions I urge the FTC to take:
- Commercial surveillance technologies: As surveillance devices flood the market, we’ve seen the installation of the largest private surveillance network in US history. Doorbell cameras, floodlight cameras, AI powered dash cameras, automated license plate readers, facial recognition and other tools of biometric surveillance give corporations roaming eyes in every neighborhood, shopping center, and street in our communities. It’s become nearly impossible to avoid being surveilled in daily life. The unprecedented amounts of data swept up en masse by private surveillance networks give corporations the information necessary to feed development of new products and adopt manipulative marketing techniques without any respect for privacy or even the illusion that people could opt in or out of the system. This surveillance has led to the most intimate details of our lives being monetized and our daily whereabouts tracked. Once companies have gathered this private, sensitive data, it becomes subject to misuse in ways users could never have anticipated. In response to the onslaught of surveillance technologies, the FTC must ban the use, sale, and dissemination of facial recognition technology, and institute human rights-based protections that give people full autonomy and control over their personal information and digital bodies, including image, voice, and whereabouts.
- Data minimization: We must dispose of the false premise that “accept all'' policies are in any way a sign of meaningful or informed consent. Companies draft privacy language that the majority of the public are unable to read and understand. Meanwhile, the data collected by a company doesn’t always stay with that entity, as companies profit off the sharing of individuals’ data with third-party data brokers. Not only do many people not realize this is a common practice, but it is also unlikely they could understand the potential impacts or how this data could be used as it changes hands. As this data is collected and merged, companies are able to predict personal behavior and infer ones' identity, despite industry claims of anonymity. The aggregation of this data allows private entities to conduct discriminatory prediction, which results in biased practices and policies that negatively impact marginalized and vulnerable communities. To address issues with data collection, the FTC should impose strict data minimization obligations on companies and ensure that individuals retain maximal control over their own personal data.
- Data security: After a private entity has collected consumer data, the onus must be on that company to take meaningful steps to ensure the security of that data. Endless examples of cyberattacks that have exposed peoples’ personal, biometric, financial, and other data highlight how the information companies collect is a target for hackers, data thieves, and other bad actors. In order to fully protect consumer data, the FTC must require all internet enabled consumer products to employ end-to-end encryption by default. The FTC should also require companies to regularly perform data privacy, civil rights impact audits to ensure accountability for data security and transparency around breaches and company practices. 
The FTC must use its full authority to not only address issues that are prevalent at present, but to proactively protect users in the future as technology and commercial surveillance practices evolve.

In our post-Roe world, these threats have become more significant for people who can get pregnant. These widespread harms directly result from the unfair and deceptive mass collection, use, and sharing of peoples’ data.
I fully support the FTC in exercizing the full extent of its authority to address the entire life cycle of data—collection, use, management, retention, and deletion—in order to provide people with significant protection from discrimination and related data harms. Here are some specific actions I urge the FTC to take:
- Commercial surveillance technologies: As surveillance devices flood the market, we’ve seen the installation of the largest private surveillance network in US history. Doorbell cameras, floodlight cameras, AI powered dash cameras, automated license plate readers, facial recognition and other tools of biometric surveillance give corporations roaming eyes in every neighborhood, shopping center, and street in our communities. It’s become nearly impossible to avoid being surveilled in daily life. The unprecedented amounts of data swept up en masse by private surveillance networks give corporations the information necessary to feed development of new products and adopt manipulative marketing techniques without any respect for privacy or even the illusion that people could opt in or out of the system. This surveillance has led to the most intimate details of our lives being monetized and our daily whereabouts tracked. Once companies have gathered this private, sensitive data, it becomes subject to misuse in ways users could never have anticipated. In response to the onslaught of surveillance technologies, the FTC must ban the use, sale, and dissemination of facial recognition technology, and institute human rights-based protections that give people full autonomy and control over their personal information and digital bodies, including image, voice, and whereabouts.
- Data minimization: We must dispose of the false premise that “accept all'' policies are in any way a sign of meaningful or informed consent. Companies draft privacy language that the majority of the public are unable to read and understand. Meanwhile, the data collected by a company doesn’t always stay with that entity, as companies profit off the sharing of individuals’ data with third-party data brokers. Not only do many people not realize this is a common practice, but it is also unlikely they could understand the potential impacts or how this data could be used as it changes hands. As this data is collected and merged, companies are able to predict personal behavior and infer ones' identity, despite industry claims of anonymity. The aggregation of this data allows private entities to conduct discriminatory prediction, which results in biased practices and policies that negatively impact marginalized and vulnerable communities. To address issues with data collection, the FTC should impose strict data minimization obligations on companies and ensure that individuals retain maximal control over their own personal data.
- Data security: After a private entity has collected consumer data, the onus must be on that company to take meaningful steps to ensure the security of that data. Endless examples of cyberattacks that have exposed peoples’ personal, biometric, financial, and other data highlight how the information companies collect is a target for hackers, data thieves, and other bad actors. In order to fully protect consumer data, the FTC must require all internet enabled consumer products to employ end-to-end encryption by default. The FTC should also require companies to regularly perform data privacy, civil rights impact audits to ensure accountability for data security and transparency around breaches and company practices. 
The FTC must use its full authority to not only address issues that are prevalent at present, but to proactively protect users in the future as technology and commercial surveillance practices evolve. I thank the FTC for launching this rulemaking process and support its efforts to address the harms of surveillance and data abuses.",,,,,,,

The unprecedented amounts of data swept up en masse by private surveillance networks give corporations the information necessary to feed development of new products and adopt manipulative marketing techniques without any respect for privacy or even the illusion that people could opt in or out of the system. This surveillance has led to the most intimate details of our lives being monetized and our daily whereabouts tracked. Once companies have gathered this private, sensitive data, it becomes subject to misuse in ways users could never have anticipated. In response to the onslaught of surveillance technologies, the FTC must ban the use, sale, and dissemination of facial recognition technology, and institute human rights-based protections that give people full autonomy and control over their personal information and digital bodies, including image, voice, and whereabouts.
- Data minimization: We must dispose of the false premise that “accept all'' policies are in any way a sign of meaningful or informed consent. Companies draft privacy language that the majority of the public are unable to read and understand. Meanwhile, the data collected by a company doesn’t always stay with that entity, as companies profit off the sharing of individuals’ data with third-party data brokers. Not only do many people not realize this is a common practice, but it is also unlikely they could understand the potential impacts or how this data could be used as it changes hands. As this data is collected and merged, companies are able to predict personal behavior and infer ones' identity, despite industry claims of anonymity. The aggregation of this data allows private entities to conduct discriminatory prediction, which results in biased practices and policies that negatively impact marginalized and vulnerable communities. To address issues with data collection, the FTC should impose strict data minimization obligations on companies and ensure that individuals retain maximal control over their own personal data.
- Data security: After a private entity has collected consumer data, the onus must be on that company to take meaningful steps to ensure the security of that data. Endless examples of cyberattacks that have exposed peoples’ personal, biometric, financial, and other data highlight how the information companies collect is a target for hackers, data thieves, and other bad actors. In order to fully protect consumer data, the FTC must require all internet enabled consumer products to employ end-to-end encryption by default. The FTC should also require companies to regularly perform data privacy, civil rights impact audits to ensure accountability for data security and transparency around breaches and company practices. 
The FTC must use its full authority to not only address issues that are prevalent at present, but to proactively protect users in the future as technology and commercial surveillance practices evolve.

Reckless data practices replicate and amplify inequities stemming from systemic and historic discrimination. The harms caused by widespread, unregulated corporate surveillance and data abuses pose a direct threat to the public at large, and can disproportionately discriminate against people of color, women, members of the LGBTQ+ community, religious minorities, persons with disabilities, economically disadvantaged, immigrants and other marginalized groups. In our post-Roe world, these threats have become more significant for people who can get pregnant. These widespread harms directly result from the unfair and deceptive mass collection, use, and sharing of peoples’ data.
I fully support the FTC in exercizing the full extent of its authority to address the entire life cycle of data—collection, use, management, retention, and deletion—in order to provide people with significant protection from discrimination and related data harms.

Reckless data practices replicate and amplify inequities stemming from systemic and historic discrimination. The harms caused by widespread, unregulated corporate surveillance and data abuses pose a direct threat to the public at large, and can disproportionately discriminate against people of color, women, members of the LGBTQ+ community, religious minorities, persons with disabilities, economically disadvantaged, immigrants and other marginalized groups. In our post-Roe world, these threats have become more significant for people who can get pregnant. These widespread harms directly result from the unfair and deceptive mass collection, use, and sharing of peoples’ data.
I fully support the FTC in exercizing the full extent of its authority to address the entire life cycle of data—collection, use, management, retention, and deletion—in order to provide people with significant protection from discrimination and related data harms. Here are some specific actions I urge the FTC to take:
- Commercial surveillance technologies: As surveillance devices flood the market, we’ve seen the installation of the largest private surveillance network in US history. Doorbell cameras, floodlight cameras, AI powered dash cameras, automated license plate readers, facial recognition and other tools of biometric surveillance give corporations roaming eyes in every neighborhood, shopping center, and street in our communities. It’s become nearly impossible to avoid being surveilled in daily life. The unprecedented amounts of data swept up en masse by private surveillance networks give corporations the information necessary to feed development of new products and adopt manipulative marketing techniques without any respect for privacy or even the illusion that people could opt in or out of the system. This surveillance has led to the most intimate details of our lives being monetized and our daily whereabouts tracked. Once companies have gathered this private, sensitive data, it becomes subject to misuse in ways users could never have anticipated. In response to the onslaught of surveillance technologies, the FTC must ban the use, sale, and dissemination of facial recognition technology, and institute human rights-based protections that give people full autonomy and control over their personal information and digital bodies, including image, voice, and whereabouts.

Reckless data practices replicate and amplify inequities stemming from systemic and historic discrimination. The harms caused by widespread, unregulated corporate surveillance and data abuses pose a direct threat to the public at large, and can disproportionately discriminate against people of color, women, members of the LGBTQ+ community, religious minorities, persons with disabilities, economically disadvantaged, immigrants and other marginalized groups. In our post-Roe world, these threats have become more significant for people who can get pregnant. These widespread harms directly result from the unfair and deceptive mass collection, use, and sharing of peoples’ data.
I fully support the FTC in exercizing the full extent of its authority to address the entire life cycle of data—collection, use, management, retention, and deletion—in order to provide people with significant protection from discrimination and related data harms. Here are some specific actions I urge the FTC to take:
- Commercial surveillance technologies: As surveillance devices flood the market, we’ve seen the installation of the largest private surveillance network in US history. Doorbell cameras, floodlight cameras, AI powered dash cameras, automated license plate readers, facial recognition and other tools of biometric surveillance give corporations roaming eyes in every neighborhood, shopping center, and street in our communities. It’s become nearly impossible to avoid being surveilled in daily life. The unprecedented amounts of data swept up en masse by private surveillance networks give corporations the information necessary to feed development of new products and adopt manipulative marketing techniques without any respect for privacy or even the illusion that people could opt in or out of the system. This surveillance has led to the most intimate details of our lives being monetized and our daily whereabouts tracked. Once companies have gathered this private, sensitive data, it becomes subject to misuse in ways users could never have anticipated. In response to the onslaught of surveillance technologies, the FTC must ban the use, sale, and dissemination of facial recognition technology, and institute human rights-based protections that give people full autonomy and control over their personal information and digital bodies, including image, voice, and whereabouts.
- Data minimization: We must dispose of the false premise that “accept all'' policies are in any way a sign of meaningful or informed consent. Companies draft privacy language that the majority of the public are unable to read and understand. Meanwhile, the data collected by a company doesn’t always stay with that entity, as companies profit off the sharing of individuals’ data with third-party data brokers. Not only do many people not realize this is a common practice, but it is also unlikely they could understand the potential impacts or how this data could be used as it changes hands. As this data is collected and merged, companies are able to predict personal behavior and infer ones' identity, despite industry claims of anonymity. The aggregation of this data allows private entities to conduct discriminatory prediction, which results in biased practices and policies that negatively impact marginalized and vulnerable communities. To address issues with data collection, the FTC should impose strict data minimization obligations on companies and ensure that individuals retain maximal control over their own personal data.
- Data security: After a private entity has collected consumer data, the onus must be on that company to take meaningful steps to ensure the security of that data.

Reckless data practices replicate and amplify inequities stemming from systemic and historic discrimination. The harms caused by widespread, unregulated corporate surveillance and data abuses pose a direct threat to the public at large, and can disproportionately discriminate against people of color, women, members of the LGBTQ+ community, religious minorities, persons with disabilities, economically disadvantaged, immigrants and other marginalized groups. In our post-Roe world, these threats have become more significant for people who can get pregnant. These widespread harms directly result from the unfair and deceptive mass collection, use, and sharing of peoples’ data.
I fully support the FTC in exercizing the full extent of its authority to address the entire life cycle of data—collection, use, management, retention, and deletion—in order to provide people with significant protection from discrimination and related data harms. Here are some specific actions I urge the FTC to take:
- Commercial surveillance technologies: As surveillance devices flood the market, we’ve seen the installation of the largest private surveillance network in US history. Doorbell cameras, floodlight cameras, AI powered dash cameras, automated license plate readers, facial recognition and other tools of biometric surveillance give corporations roaming eyes in every neighborhood, shopping center, and street in our communities. It’s become nearly impossible to avoid being surveilled in daily life. The unprecedented amounts of data swept up en masse by private surveillance networks give corporations the information necessary to feed development of new products and adopt manipulative marketing techniques without any respect for privacy or even the illusion that people could opt in or out of the system. This surveillance has led to the most intimate details of our lives being monetized and our daily whereabouts tracked. Once companies have gathered this private, sensitive data, it becomes subject to misuse in ways users could never have anticipated. In response to the onslaught of surveillance technologies, the FTC must ban the use, sale, and dissemination of facial recognition technology, and institute human rights-based protections that give people full autonomy and control over their personal information and digital bodies, including image, voice, and whereabouts.
- Data minimization: We must dispose of the false premise that “accept all'' policies are in any way a sign of meaningful or informed consent. Companies draft privacy language that the majority of the public are unable to read and understand. Meanwhile, the data collected by a company doesn’t always stay with that entity, as companies profit off the sharing of individuals’ data with third-party data brokers. Not only do many people not realize this is a common practice, but it is also unlikely they could understand the potential impacts or how this data could be used as it changes hands. As this data is collected and merged, companies are able to predict personal behavior and infer ones' identity, despite industry claims of anonymity. The aggregation of this data allows private entities to conduct discriminatory prediction, which results in biased practices and policies that negatively impact marginalized and vulnerable communities. To address issues with data collection, the FTC should impose strict data minimization obligations on companies and ensure that individuals retain maximal control over their own personal data.
- Data security: After a private entity has collected consumer data, the onus must be on that company to take meaningful steps to ensure the security of that data. Endless examples of cyberattacks that have exposed peoples’ personal, biometric, financial, and other data highlight how the information companies collect is a target for hackers, data thieves, and other bad actors. In order to fully protect consumer data, the FTC must require all internet enabled consumer products to employ end-to-end encryption by default. The FTC should also require companies to regularly perform data privacy, civil rights impact audits to ensure accountability for data security and transparency around breaches and company practices. 
The FTC must use its full authority to not only address issues that are prevalent at present, but to proactively protect users in the future as technology and commercial surveillance practices evolve.

These widespread harms directly result from the unfair and deceptive mass collection, use, and sharing of peoples’ data.
I fully support the FTC in exercizing the full extent of its authority to address the entire life cycle of data—collection, use, management, retention, and deletion—in order to provide people with significant protection from discrimination and related data harms. Here are some specific actions I urge the FTC to take:
- Commercial surveillance technologies: As surveillance devices flood the market, we’ve seen the installation of the largest private surveillance network in US history. Doorbell cameras, floodlight cameras, AI powered dash cameras, automated license plate readers, facial recognition and other tools of biometric surveillance give corporations roaming eyes in every neighborhood, shopping center, and street in our communities. It’s become nearly impossible to avoid being surveilled in daily life. The unprecedented amounts of data swept up en masse by private surveillance networks give corporations the information necessary to feed development of new products and adopt manipulative marketing techniques without any respect for privacy or even the illusion that people could opt in or out of the system. This surveillance has led to the most intimate details of our lives being monetized and our daily whereabouts tracked. Once companies have gathered this private, sensitive data, it becomes subject to misuse in ways users could never have anticipated. In response to the onslaught of surveillance technologies, the FTC must ban the use, sale, and dissemination of facial recognition technology, and institute human rights-based protections that give people full autonomy and control over their personal information and digital bodies, including image, voice, and whereabouts.
- Data minimization: We must dispose of the false premise that “accept all'' policies are in any way a sign of meaningful or informed consent. Companies draft privacy language that the majority of the public are unable to read and understand. Meanwhile, the data collected by a company doesn’t always stay with that entity, as companies profit off the sharing of individuals’ data with third-party data brokers. Not only do many people not realize this is a common practice, but it is also unlikely they could understand the potential impacts or how this data could be used as it changes hands. As this data is collected and merged, companies are able to predict personal behavior and infer ones' identity, despite industry claims of anonymity. The aggregation of this data allows private entities to conduct discriminatory prediction, which results in biased practices and policies that negatively impact marginalized and vulnerable communities. To address issues with data collection, the FTC should impose strict data minimization obligations on companies and ensure that individuals retain maximal control over their own personal data.
- Data security: After a private entity has collected consumer data, the onus must be on that company to take meaningful steps to ensure the security of that data. Endless examples of cyberattacks that have exposed peoples’ personal, biometric, financial, and other data highlight how the information companies collect is a target for hackers, data thieves, and other bad actors. In order to fully protect consumer data, the FTC must require all internet enabled consumer products to employ end-to-end encryption by default. The FTC should also require companies to regularly perform data privacy, civil rights impact audits to ensure accountability for data security and transparency around breaches and company practices. 
The FTC must use its full authority to not only address issues that are prevalent at present, but to proactively protect users in the future as technology and commercial surveillance practices evolve. I thank the FTC for launching this rulemaking process and support its efforts to address the harms of surveillance and data abuses.",,,,,,,

The unprecedented amounts of data swept up en masse by private surveillance networks give corporations the information necessary to feed development of new products and adopt manipulative marketing techniques without any respect for privacy or even the illusion that people could opt in or out of the system. This surveillance has led to the most intimate details of our lives being monetized and our daily whereabouts tracked. Once companies have gathered this private, sensitive data, it becomes subject to misuse in ways users could never have anticipated. In response to the onslaught of surveillance technologies, the FTC must ban the use, sale, and dissemination of facial recognition technology, and institute human rights-based protections that give people full autonomy and control over their personal information and digital bodies, including image, voice, and whereabouts.
- Data minimization: We must dispose of the false premise that “accept all'' policies are in any way a sign of meaningful or informed consent. Companies draft privacy language that the majority of the public are unable to read and understand. Meanwhile, the data collected by a company doesn’t always stay with that entity, as companies profit off the sharing of individuals’ data with third-party data brokers. Not only do many people not realize this is a common practice, but it is also unlikely they could understand the potential impacts or how this data could be used as it changes hands. As this data is collected and merged, companies are able to predict personal behavior and infer ones' identity, despite industry claims of anonymity. The aggregation of this data allows private entities to conduct discriminatory prediction, which results in biased practices and policies that negatively impact marginalized and vulnerable communities. To address issues with data collection, the FTC should impose strict data minimization obligations on companies and ensure that individuals retain maximal control over their own personal data.
- Data security: After a private entity has collected consumer data, the onus must be on that company to take meaningful steps to ensure the security of that data. Endless examples of cyberattacks that have exposed peoples’ personal, biometric, financial, and other data highlight how the information companies collect is a target for hackers, data thieves, and other bad actors. In order to fully protect consumer data, the FTC must require all internet enabled consumer products to employ end-to-end encryption by default. The FTC should also require companies to regularly perform data privacy, civil rights impact audits to ensure accountability for data security and transparency around breaches and company practices. 
The FTC must use its full authority to not only address issues that are prevalent at present, but to proactively protect users in the future as technology and commercial surveillance practices evolve.

Reckless data practices replicate and amplify inequities stemming from systemic and historic discrimination. The harms caused by widespread, unregulated corporate surveillance and data abuses pose a direct threat to the public at large, and can disproportionately discriminate against people of color, women, members of the LGBTQ+ community, religious minorities, persons with disabilities, economically disadvantaged, immigrants and other marginalized groups. In our post-Roe world, these threats have become more significant for people who can get pregnant. These widespread harms directly result from the unfair and deceptive mass collection, use, and sharing of peoples’ data.
I fully support the FTC in exercizing the full extent of its authority to address the entire life cycle of data—collection, use, management, retention, and deletion—in order to provide people with significant protection from discrimination and related data harms. Here are some specific actions I urge the FTC to take:

Reckless data practices replicate and amplify inequities stemming from systemic and historic discrimination. The harms caused by widespread, unregulated corporate surveillance and data abuses pose a direct threat to the public at large, and can disproportionately discriminate against people of color, women, members of the LGBTQ+ community, religious minorities, persons with disabilities, economically disadvantaged, immigrants and other marginalized groups. In our post-Roe world, these threats have become more significant for people who can get pregnant. These widespread harms directly result from the unfair and deceptive mass collection, use, and sharing of peoples’ data.
I fully support the FTC in exercizing the full extent of its authority to address the entire life cycle of data—collection, use, management, retention, and deletion—in order to provide people with significant protection from discrimination and related data harms. Here are some specific actions I urge the FTC to take:
- Commercial surveillance technologies: As surveillance devices flood the market, we’ve seen the installation of the largest private surveillance network in US history. Doorbell cameras, floodlight cameras, AI powered dash cameras, automated license plate readers, facial recognition and other tools of biometric surveillance give corporations roaming eyes in every neighborhood, shopping center, and street in our communities. It’s become nearly impossible to avoid being surveilled in daily life. The unprecedented amounts of data swept up en masse by private surveillance networks give corporations the information necessary to feed development of new products and adopt manipulative marketing techniques without any respect for privacy or even the illusion that people could opt in or out of the system. This surveillance has led to the most intimate details of our lives being monetized and our daily whereabouts tracked. Once companies have gathered this private, sensitive data, it becomes subject to misuse in ways users could never have anticipated. In response to the onslaught of surveillance technologies, the FTC must ban the use, sale, and dissemination of facial recognition technology, and institute human rights-based protections that give people full autonomy and control over their personal information and digital bodies, including image, voice, and whereabouts.
- Data minimization: We must dispose of the false premise that “accept all'' policies are in any way a sign of meaningful or informed consent. Companies draft privacy language that the majority of the public are unable to read and understand. Meanwhile, the data collected by a company doesn’t always stay with that entity, as companies profit off the sharing of individuals’ data with third-party data brokers.

Reckless data practices replicate and amplify inequities stemming from systemic and historic discrimination. The harms caused by widespread, unregulated corporate surveillance and data abuses pose a direct threat to the public at large, and can disproportionately discriminate against people of color, women, members of the LGBTQ+ community, religious minorities, persons with disabilities, economically disadvantaged, immigrants and other marginalized groups. In our post-Roe world, these threats have become more significant for people who can get pregnant. These widespread harms directly result from the unfair and deceptive mass collection, use, and sharing of peoples’ data.
I fully support the FTC in exercizing the full extent of its authority to address the entire life cycle of data—collection, use, management, retention, and deletion—in order to provide people with significant protection from discrimination and related data harms. Here are some specific actions I urge the FTC to take:
- Commercial surveillance technologies: As surveillance devices flood the market, we’ve seen the installation of the largest private surveillance network in US history. Doorbell cameras, floodlight cameras, AI powered dash cameras, automated license plate readers, facial recognition and other tools of biometric surveillance give corporations roaming eyes in every neighborhood, shopping center, and street in our communities. It’s become nearly impossible to avoid being surveilled in daily life. The unprecedented amounts of data swept up en masse by private surveillance networks give corporations the information necessary to feed development of new products and adopt manipulative marketing techniques without any respect for privacy or even the illusion that people could opt in or out of the system. This surveillance has led to the most intimate details of our lives being monetized and our daily whereabouts tracked. Once companies have gathered this private, sensitive data, it becomes subject to misuse in ways users could never have anticipated. In response to the onslaught of surveillance technologies, the FTC must ban the use, sale, and dissemination of facial recognition technology, and institute human rights-based protections that give people full autonomy and control over their personal information and digital bodies, including image, voice, and whereabouts.
- Data minimization: We must dispose of the false premise that “accept all'' policies are in any way a sign of meaningful or informed consent. Companies draft privacy language that the majority of the public are unable to read and understand. Meanwhile, the data collected by a company doesn’t always stay with that entity, as companies profit off the sharing of individuals’ data with third-party data brokers. Not only do many people not realize this is a common practice, but it is also unlikely they could understand the potential impacts or how this data could be used as it changes hands. As this data is collected and merged, companies are able to predict personal behavior and infer ones' identity, despite industry claims of anonymity. The aggregation of this data allows private entities to conduct discriminatory prediction, which results in biased practices and policies that negatively impact marginalized and vulnerable communities. To address issues with data collection, the FTC should impose strict data minimization obligations on companies and ensure that individuals retain maximal control over their own personal data.
- Data security: After a private entity has collected consumer data, the onus must be on that company to take meaningful steps to ensure the security of that data. Endless examples of cyberattacks that have exposed peoples’ personal, biometric, financial, and other data highlight how the information companies collect is a target for hackers, data thieves, and other bad actors.

Reckless data practices replicate and amplify inequities stemming from systemic and historic discrimination. The harms caused by widespread, unregulated corporate surveillance and data abuses pose a direct threat to the public at large, and can disproportionately discriminate against people of color, women, members of the LGBTQ+ community, religious minorities, persons with disabilities, economically disadvantaged, immigrants and other marginalized groups. In our post-Roe world, these threats have become more significant for people who can get pregnant. These widespread harms directly result from the unfair and deceptive mass collection, use, and sharing of peoples’ data.
I fully support the FTC in exercizing the full extent of its authority to address the entire life cycle of data—collection, use, management, retention, and deletion—in order to provide people with significant protection from discrimination and related data harms. Here are some specific actions I urge the FTC to take:
- Commercial surveillance technologies: As surveillance devices flood the market, we’ve seen the installation of the largest private surveillance network in US history. Doorbell cameras, floodlight cameras, AI powered dash cameras, automated license plate readers, facial recognition and other tools of biometric surveillance give corporations roaming eyes in every neighborhood, shopping center, and street in our communities. It’s become nearly impossible to avoid being surveilled in daily life. The unprecedented amounts of data swept up en masse by private surveillance networks give corporations the information necessary to feed development of new products and adopt manipulative marketing techniques without any respect for privacy or even the illusion that people could opt in or out of the system. This surveillance has led to the most intimate details of our lives being monetized and our daily whereabouts tracked. Once companies have gathered this private, sensitive data, it becomes subject to misuse in ways users could never have anticipated. In response to the onslaught of surveillance technologies, the FTC must ban the use, sale, and dissemination of facial recognition technology, and institute human rights-based protections that give people full autonomy and control over their personal information and digital bodies, including image, voice, and whereabouts.
- Data minimization: We must dispose of the false premise that “accept all'' policies are in any way a sign of meaningful or informed consent. Companies draft privacy language that the majority of the public are unable to read and understand. Meanwhile, the data collected by a company doesn’t always stay with that entity, as companies profit off the sharing of individuals’ data with third-party data brokers. Not only do many people not realize this is a common practice, but it is also unlikely they could understand the potential impacts or how this data could be used as it changes hands. As this data is collected and merged, companies are able to predict personal behavior and infer ones' identity, despite industry claims of anonymity. The aggregation of this data allows private entities to conduct discriminatory prediction, which results in biased practices and policies that negatively impact marginalized and vulnerable communities. To address issues with data collection, the FTC should impose strict data minimization obligations on companies and ensure that individuals retain maximal control over their own personal data.
- Data security: After a private entity has collected consumer data, the onus must be on that company to take meaningful steps to ensure the security of that data. Endless examples of cyberattacks that have exposed peoples’ personal, biometric, financial, and other data highlight how the information companies collect is a target for hackers, data thieves, and other bad actors. In order to fully protect consumer data, the FTC must require all internet enabled consumer products to employ end-to-end encryption by default. The FTC should also require companies to regularly perform data privacy, civil rights impact audits to ensure accountability for data security and transparency around breaches and company practices. 
The FTC must use its full authority to not only address issues that are prevalent at present, but to proactively protect users in the future as technology and commercial surveillance practices evolve.

In our post-Roe world, these threats have become more significant for people who can get pregnant. These widespread harms directly result from the unfair and deceptive mass collection, use, and sharing of peoples’ data.
I fully support the FTC in exercizing the full extent of its authority to address the entire life cycle of data—collection, use, management, retention, and deletion—in order to provide people with significant protection from discrimination and related data harms. Here are some specific actions I urge the FTC to take:
- Commercial surveillance technologies: As surveillance devices flood the market, we’ve seen the installation of the largest private surveillance network in US history. Doorbell cameras, floodlight cameras, AI powered dash cameras, automated license plate readers, facial recognition and other tools of biometric surveillance give corporations roaming eyes in every neighborhood, shopping center, and street in our communities. It’s become nearly impossible to avoid being surveilled in daily life. The unprecedented amounts of data swept up en masse by private surveillance networks give corporations the information necessary to feed development of new products and adopt manipulative marketing techniques without any respect for privacy or even the illusion that people could opt in or out of the system. This surveillance has led to the most intimate details of our lives being monetized and our daily whereabouts tracked. Once companies have gathered this private, sensitive data, it becomes subject to misuse in ways users could never have anticipated. In response to the onslaught of surveillance technologies, the FTC must ban the use, sale, and dissemination of facial recognition technology, and institute human rights-based protections that give people full autonomy and control over their personal information and digital bodies, including image, voice, and whereabouts.
- Data minimization: We must dispose of the false premise that “accept all'' policies are in any way a sign of meaningful or informed consent. Companies draft privacy language that the majority of the public are unable to read and understand. Meanwhile, the data collected by a company doesn’t always stay with that entity, as companies profit off the sharing of individuals’ data with third-party data brokers. Not only do many people not realize this is a common practice, but it is also unlikely they could understand the potential impacts or how this data could be used as it changes hands. As this data is collected and merged, companies are able to predict personal behavior and infer ones' identity, despite industry claims of anonymity. The aggregation of this data allows private entities to conduct discriminatory prediction, which results in biased practices and policies that negatively impact marginalized and vulnerable communities. To address issues with data collection, the FTC should impose strict data minimization obligations on companies and ensure that individuals retain maximal control over their own personal data.
- Data security: After a private entity has collected consumer data, the onus must be on that company to take meaningful steps to ensure the security of that data. Endless examples of cyberattacks that have exposed peoples’ personal, biometric, financial, and other data highlight how the information companies collect is a target for hackers, data thieves, and other bad actors. In order to fully protect consumer data, the FTC must require all internet enabled consumer products to employ end-to-end encryption by default. The FTC should also require companies to regularly perform data privacy, civil rights impact audits to ensure accountability for data security and transparency around breaches and company practices. 
The FTC must use its full authority to not only address issues that are prevalent at present, but to proactively protect users in the future as technology and commercial surveillance practices evolve. I thank the FTC for launching this rulemaking process and support its efforts to address the harms of surveillance and data abuses.",,,,,,,

As a former local school board member, I am very concerned about how the number of student data breaches has skyrocketed in recent years, through hacking, ransomware, and other cybersecurity events. Moreover, too often school vendors are also using and abusing student data for commercial uses. I urge you to require enforceable contracts that require encryption, as well as other strong security standards for the collection, disclosure, and use of student data. Also, these contracts must prohibit vendors from accessing or using any data they do not need for the purposes of carrying out their contracted services, and the information they do collect should be deleted as soon as possible, preferably at the conclusion of each school year or at the very least, when students graduate or leave the district.

I also urge you to strongly prohibit the use of student data for any commercial purpose, including allowing vendors to sell it, to use it to target ads, and/or to use it to develop new products or services. 

Yours sincerely,
Maureen McCarron, M.A., CCC/SLP (Retired)

It is long past time to end the practice of surveilling internet users in the name of commerce.  These spying practices allow database brokers to build dossiers on individuals and traffic them to marketers.  Why does anyone need all this surveillance data to sell a shirt or a pair of shoes to someone.  It is time to stop this practice and free consumers of the collection of their digital behaviors for use by advertisers.  I have read their positions about how this helps them conduct commerce and find this to be disingenuous and without merit.  For decades advertisers were able to reach people thru anonymous cohort groups and the economy still grew.  Now we are to believe that someone selling toothpaste needs to target me directly or else they will incur economic hardship..Stop targeting people online and stop trafficking their information.  This may also be a national security issue.  The folks who traffic data will sell it to whoever wishes to buy it...even foreign powers.

Ignore the stupid form letters and listen to this. Anything someone creates by their actions is their property. Sleazy business bozos have found another loophole to run a scam on people with money. The advertising industry is being ripped off by these sleazes' strategy of turning people into product, with NO option for people to pay a reasonable fee! Users are forced to give up the property they create with their actions by the use of the system. And advertisers are kept in a ""spam or nothing"" model by these sleazes because that's how to get them to pay the most, for the least return.
FYI, there will ALWAYS be sleazebags trying to find or make loopholes so they can scam money. Figuring out the correct approach to cut the legs out from under these sleazebags, so we don't HAVE RICH SLEAZEBAGS IN POWER, is your job. 
You have my support whichever method to choose to accomplish this. One principle is clear - people are NOT PRODUCT. People are property owners and have all the rights to what they create. Forcing them to BARTER away their property in exchange for tenancy of any kind, is absolutely a violation of their rights. Offering payment options is an accepted legal method of commerce and brings the whole system into the light.

After being sued repeatedly, my employer has gotten fairly decent at privacy and data regulation--it is probably the best out of all the largest US tech companies--but I have found gigantic caches of personally identifiable information visible to over 100,000 people. This is not great, and this is probably the best in the industry; we laugh at how badly some of our peers, like Amazon, handle and protect data, and it only gets worse from there.

In the lax, deregulated data environment in the US, legislation is 15 years behind technology and falling further behind every day, and any consequences are meaningless. To give some examples: Experian has repeatedly exposed user data in the years after its 2017 leak affecting 1 in 3 Americans (including myself), and still exists as a business (that continues, incidentally, to violate the CAN-SPAM Act by sending non-opt-out-able monthly updates letting me know that my credit card balance has changed). Most car manufacturers now transmit the car's location to the manufacturer continuously or whenever the doors are opened. Cell phones and app developers are doing similarly and bundling and selling that information to any buyer, as the NYT and other papers have reported on at length. EFacial recognition AI has reached the point where no one can post pictures of themselves or their children without becoming identifiable and findable by any person; it also has enabled an epidemic of deepfaked pornography against every woman in existence. We need rights over our likenesses and faces to protect against other people exploiting them. We need rights over our data. We need meaningful consequences for the data brokers like Experian that acquire Americans' data without our consent, behave negligently with that data, and continue to generate profits despite that negligence.

We need European-style regulation on data as soon as possible, with very strong teeth. A $50 million fine is not a deterrence for many multibillion-dollar companies. Not only does the mass unregulated collection, sale, and distribution of personal data present personal risks to American citizens, who are at increased risk of identity theft, stalking, harassment, and violence as individuals (as the many, many victims of doxxing can attest), but also makes the country extremely vulnerable to malignant state actors and criminal organizations, because every single one of us is a very soft, very attractive target, including those in crucial positions in governments, utility companies, technical and financial companies, hospitals, and other core infrastructure.",,,,,,,

These comments concern item 80: opt-out choices and commercial surveillance.

As a consumer, I do NOT feel that industry standard opt-out policies protect me.

In December 2021, a number of people in my family became ill with possible Covid, and we tried to find ways to get tested. Many places were booked up or closed due to snow or lack of staff, but I found one appointment near my home at Snoqualmie Valley Hospital. Snoqualmie Valley Hospital, like many test sites in my area and nationally, scheduled Covid tests using Solv Health.

In order to make an appointment at Solv Health, I needed to agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. According to the Terms of Service, my visit to Solv was to be shared with four advertising networks:

- Google Analytics and Google AdWords
- HotJar
- Segment.io
- Mixpanel

They would also link my phone with social media networks, including

- Facebook
- Instagram
- Twitter

The policy notes these networks may use cookies, beacons, or tracking pixels to trace the same user across multiple sites.

My email would be shared and linked with four additional service providers:

- Iterable, Inc.
- The Rocket Science Group LLC, doing business as MailChimp
- Salesforce, doing business as Pardot
- Sendgrid

So, to understand where all the data went and how it could be used, I would need to read eleven additional privacy policies and potentially opt-out. If you include Solv Health’s own privacy policy, I would need to opt-out of data sharing twelve times. Except, if I refused Solv's own policy, I would not have been able to get a Covid test, which wasn't really an option when the tests were so hard to find.

Opt-out regulations do not protect me from vendors like Solv Health:

The default consumer privacy policy must be ""opt-in"", to every single company that will receive the data:  When I visit a website the default should be that I’m visiting that site, not that I’m giving data to eleven other companies at the same time.

Each specific use of my data should require consent. As someone seeking health services, an ""opt-out of everything"" option would not meet my needs: I wanted Solv Health to use my information to create a test appointment at Snoqualmie Valley Hospital; I wanted my phone number to be used to call me with the result.

But, there is no reason why so many companies needed to be involved to accomplish what I actually wanted. And now these companies have my data, what else are they going to do with it? If I followed the privacy policy links another level deeper, maybe these eleven companies also share data. With the level of data sharing common in tech today, only specific and incremental ""opt-in"" allows consumers to truly decide where our data goes.

When making choices the use of my data, I want the options presented to me to be specific enough to make well-informed decisions. Solv Health’s privacy policies split my data by type or by source: ""certain information,"" ""certain personal information,"" and ""certain personal health information,"" ""data you provide,"" ""data collected by the servers"", ""data collected by cookies,"" ""data collected by social media platforms,"" and so on. I shouldn’t have to guess what these euphemisms mean. Strong privacy regulations would require privacy policies to be crystal clear and explicit: ""your name and address,"" ""your email address,"" ""your targeted advertising profile, includes your age, gender, zip code, and health insurance status,"" ""your medical results,"" ""your credit card number,"" ""your web browsing history.""

The technology industry would have you believe that some of my data is ""sensitive"" but other parts are ""non-sensitive,"" and that only the ""sensitive"" data needs to be carefully regulated. I do not draw such distinctions. As someone who works as a data engineer, I understand that machine learning models can be trained on ""non-sensitive"" data to predict ""sensitive"" data with high accuracy, and that companies can and do subscribe to services to de-anonymize data that was purchased from vendors who claim to de-indentify personal information. Furthermore, technology executives do not know what each individual person would consider sensitive or non-sensitive. As someone who is comfortable with their gender assigned at birth, I do not worry about how my gender is stored in a database, but not everyone has that level of privilege. Only the consumer can decide what is truly sensitive to them, and who they wish to trust with that information.

Finally, I urge you to ensure that privacy regulations have strong provisions for data minimization: Companies should collect the data needed to directly serve a customer, not everything they could sell to data brokers. Create rules that provide a direct answer to the question, ""Why --shouldn’t-- Solv grab Janet's web-browsing history data for Facebook?""",,,,,,,

On behalf of the team at BABL AI, I’d like to thank the Commission for providing us the opportunity to comment on Commercial Surveillance ANPR, R111004, and we would be happy to provide further clarification on any of the comments below. 

BABL AI is a leading boutique consultancy focusing on responsible AI governance, algorithm risk and impact assessments, algorithmic bias assessments and audits, and corporate training on responsible AI. We also conduct research and provide education on AI governance and ethics. From our perspective, the FTC has a unique opportunity to address gaps in the current AI governance ecosystem.

*******

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Our main recommendations are as follows:

1. (Questions 53, 54 and 56) The FTC can help improve organizations’ approach to testing ADS for accuracy, validity, fairness, or robustness by incentivizing the adoption of algorithmic impact assessments or ethical risk assessments. The FTC would ideally also require companies who deploy or procure ADS to disclose: 
		- The range of contexts where the tool is likely not to work.
		- What impact assessment or ethical risk assessment were conducted (if any).
		- The technical tests and metrics they used in measuring error rates, and what their confidence intervals are.

2. (Question 92) The FTC should promote and in some cases require (e.g. for high-risk applications or for algorithms that affect a very large number of US consumers) independent but cooperative third-party audits of ADS.  
		- Conflicts of interest between auditor and auditee are a known problem in other sectors where we rely on audits to help ensure accountability (e.g. finance). 
		- Adversarial third-party audits of ADS often suffer from limited access to the components of the ADS. 
		- Cooperative third-party audits can achieve meaningful independence through limits on cross-selling non-audit services, access requirements, the professionalization and standardization of audit services, and ensuring auditor liability for serious violations of their professional responsibilities. (Raji et al. 2022; ForHumanity) 
		- (Transparency) The FTC could also help organizations balance the benefits and harms of public disclosure by providing clear standards for transparency and public disclosure of audit results.

3. (Question 69) Organizations attempting to protect consumers from algorithmic discrimination against members of protected categories would benefit from more clarity about the implications of current anti-discrimination laws and norms. The FTC can help clarify what federal anti-discrimination and non-discrimination norms require in cases where ADS or AI contribute to such discrimination.
		- The FTC can help by clarifying what counts as unfair practices against protected groups in cases like proxy discrimination, discrimination due to disparity in access, and cases where algorithms discriminate by accurately replicating real-world disparate impacts. 
		- The FTC can also help by requiring organizations who deploy or procure ADS to compare ADS outcomes for members of protected groups to the outcomes of the baseline legacy systems that would be the alternative to an ADS.

I find that if the US is serious about protecting the privacy and well-being of its citizens, as well as keeping up with the expectations and continuously changing living standards of the rest of the developed world, it needs to prevent large companies from tracing personal data. In order to do this technology should have encrypted versions of websites. It has been shown that, in the absence of more privacy, we are willing to compromise our democracy.

It's become almost impossible to avoid corporations surveilling and collecting information on you in your day-to-day life because there's so much technology that's been made de-facto necessary that includes it, between websites, apps, smartphones, and cameras in public places. More and more ""smart"" devices come out as time goes on and that means more data being collected in more aspects of our lives.

There is also a large problem with companies not being very clear about what information they collect and what they do with it, presenting people with large legal texts that aren't easy to understand. I don't think that the people pressing the button to say they consent fully know what they're consenting to because it's not communicated very well, and it's often coerced because the technology has been made required for society. For a specific example, I had Uber wait until the moment I was about to book a ride to an appointment to try to get me to read through terms and conditions, which I feel was probably a deliberate attempt to get me to accept terms and conditions without reading them because I wouldn't have time to read them.

I think this is a privacy violation and needs to be regulated. This is especially a problem because there are lots of cyber attacks that end up leaking information to the public that I don't think should have been collected in the first place.",,,,,,,

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on Trade Regulation Rule on Commercial Surveillance and Data Security. I am currently a student at Bowling Green State University wrapping up my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering. I am writing this comment today because as a Software Engineering student, we have discussed many times regarding the ethics of collecting data for marketing, personal ads, or selling data and I feel that this proposed rule fits within those discussions. 

I would like to provide some concerns for the issue Trade Regulation Rule on Commercial Surveillance and Data Security is addressing:
1. With the personal data collected by these huge companies there are little to no restrictions as to who they can sell the data to, which could lead to personal information ending up in the wrong hands, i.e. a scammer or telemarketer, trying to get unwilling people to succumb to demands or buy something.
2. With recent restrictions on abortion rights in many states the selling  or sharing of data pertaining to menstrual cycles can be dangerous to females living within these states if the company collecting this data were to sell this information. 
3. Many individuals may find targeted ads harmful to them, as in recent years the United States has seen an increase in people diagnosed with ADHD which may cause individuals to involuntarily purchase items. With targeted ads being focused on the personal data of that user, it can be hard for them to control their impulsiveness and might end up purchasing this item.

In summary, I feel that the Trade Regulation Rule on Commercial Surveillance and Data Security is an important rule to implement for the FTC in protecting the people of the United States from large cooperation's selling personal data to different entities which could harm them without them realizing it.

I am Christine Kohnert, a retired nurse from Skagit County. Thank you for the opportunity to submit a response to the FTC’s Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) on Commercial Surveillance and Data Security.   My comments relate to questions 3-5 on hard-to-discern, and hard-to-quantify, harms of today’s commercial surveillance practices; 79, whether different standards should be required for seniors and other vulnerable populations; 80, highlighting how an opt-out approach fails to protect privacy; and 84, on how today’s transparency and disclosure requirements are not effective.
I’m old, and like many people in my age group, have a limited understanding of the Internet, technology and even the vocabulary associated with it.  Transparency and disclosure requirements  are not written for the lay person and are confusing, but our greatest fear is that we are being  robbed of our personal information and it can be used against us. Although many other populations are also  vulnerable, seniors are most frequently targeted for scams.

Earlier this year, I provided testimony to the Washington State Civil Rights & Judiciary Committee, included below, describing in detail a recent experience with a data breach letter.  I have never heard of the organization that generated this letter, Sound Generations.  I have no idea which health care or senior assistance programs I accessed that uses this organization that did not protect my personal data. 
My guess is some agency, possibly a health care provider or one of the 3 pharmacies I used  to receive my vaccines last year provided my data to Sound Generations. I was required to agree to the sharing of my data to receive care in those circumstances. I have no knowledge what agencies those providers used, or what the privacy agreements are with those agencies; but I did need those vaccines without delay.
Health insurance information, my birthdate, my phone number, my health history and conditions are very private data. I want to choose who I share it with. This could potentially have very negative impact on my life, because I have no idea if someone malicious is going to access it .

This organization instructed me to scrutinize credit reports from 3 companies, now and in the future, and  consider a security freeze with each of them. Obviously they have absolutely no consideration that I am a senior who has significant difficulty jumping through the hoops to navigate these things.

Next they suggested I file a police report. Really? We want our understaffed police departments to start handling the paperwork for every American every time they receive one of these letters?  That’s outrageous due to the sheer volume of personal data continuously being breached. The impact is hard to imagine. Additionally, how do we even answer the question “what did they take?” 

Those of us with little knowledge of tech privacy are particularly vulnerable to the harms that can be done- yet we can no longer take care of business and social needs (especially with covid) without it. The legislature needs to legislate and regulate to protect constituents. We are being forced to sign bad contracts that put us at great risk.  Please keep our needs in mind as you issue these badly-needed regulations. 

However, we are not the only vulnerable people.  Please also ensure that the regulations that protect seniors apply to everybody.

Companies that American consumers are using, are tracking, storing and selling the data and information of the people who buy and use their products and services. These companies say that consent is asked from these consumers to use their data but these consent forms are a majority of the time lengthy and hard for the average citizen to understand. With the consent forms being lengthy and being incomprehensible to the average person, the website, app, service or product that is being used, has the possibility of kicking the consumer off said product or restricting the consumer from using the product or services if they do not agree to the terms of service. Furthermore, after giving consent to the company, website or app, the terms of service could change, which happens too often, to fix bugs and glitches that come along with todays tech. With new the changes, along comes a new multiple page consent form with terms the average person can't understand. Along with these problems, how can the company ensure that someone actually gave their consent? People borrow each others electronics all the time and these products frequently require to be updated to be used. In what way and how can these companies ensure that whoever actually owns the device, is the one giving consent to the company. Lastly once consent is given, where is the accountability for these companies to store data of their consumers once they have it? Security breaches are happening more frequently in todays day and age so why are some companies not held liable when their consumers data is leaked or stolen? ",,,,,,,

Reckless data practices strongly exacerbate inequities stemming from systemic discrimination. Unregulated corporate surveillance and data abuses disproportionately target people of color, women, members of the LGBTQ+ community, persons with disabilities, and all other marginalized groups. These threats have become even more significant for people who can get pregnant now that Roe has been overturned. 

I support the FTC using all of its authority to regulate data from beginning to end— its collection, use, management, retention, and deletion—people need significant protection from discrimination and related data harm.

 Here are some specific actions I urge the FTC to take:
- Commercial surveillance technologies: With the prevalence of doorbell, floodlight, and dashboard cameras, along with license plate readers, facial recognition, and other tools of biometric surveillance, corporations have big brother-esque eyes everywhere in all neighborhoods. The staggering amounts of data in private surveillance networks allow corporations to double down on manipulative marketing techniques without respect for consumers' privacy or the consumers' ability to opt-out. Already,  intimate details of people's lives are being monetized, and once companies gather this data, it's never deleted. The FTC must ban the use, sales,  and dissemination of facial recognition technology and instead institute human rights-based protections that give people full control over their likeness in data.

- Data minimization: ""Accept all"" policies are in no way meaningful or informed consent. Companies privacy terms are not accessible to anybody but their lawyers. Even worse, companies profit from the sharing of my data with third-party data brokers, allowing it to spread beyond any individual's understanding. Despite industry claims of anonymity, investigative report after report shows how easy it is to track and identify individuals. This aggregation of this data allows private groups to create biased algorithms for discriminatory practices. Facebook's debacle with illegally violating the fair housing act is only one example. The FTC should impose strict data minimization obligations on companies and ensure that individuals retain meaningful control over their data.

- Data security: Companies today have next to no real responsibility to secure the immense amount of personal data they store. Cyberattacks have exposed peoples' personal and financial data for years with little repercussions. The FTC must require all internet consumer products to use end-to-end encryption by default. The FTC should also require companies to regularly audit their own privacy controls and civil rights impact audits of their work.


I sincerely hope the FTC uses its full power not only to address current problems but to proactively protect users in the future. I thank the FTC for this rulemaking process and support its efforts to address the harms of surveillance and data abuses.",,,,,,,

I am a parent of children ages 19 and 21. I want them to have a good start in life, and not have any data from their childhood be available to others. A major concern I have about student data from K12 is 'who controls the data and how can it be used. What can the data be combined with?' 

A second concern: my wife's employer was recently attacked for ransom, and the storage of data by school and state education agencies is of big concern because the data could be hacked. This company has huge IT teams and much better access to IT security than a typical school district. 

The schools my children attended now make extensive use of various computing devices. I never watched to see what the cookie or privacy policies are. It actually never occurred to me to do so. But there were times when they would use my computer. Now I can visualize companies planting cookies on an adult's computer when the child uses it, then using those cookies to profile me, or to possibly obtain confidential information from my computer.

Another concern: are the contracts for data collection spelled out in language a normal adult can understand? 

There's a saying: ""if you're not the customer, you're the product."" I don't think local school leaders have the bandwidth to understand all that can go wrong, or to insist on robust protection for both parents and students.

The harms caused by widespread, unregulated corporate surveillance, and data abuses, pose a direct threat to us all.

It also disproportionately discriminates against people of color, women, members of the LGBTQ+ community, religious minorities, persons with disabilities, economically disadvantaged, immigrants, and those seeking abortions.

I fully support the FTC authority to address data collection, use, management, retention, and deletion.

Protect us:

= Commercial Surveillance Tech:

As surveillance devices flood the market, it’s become nearly impossible to avoid being surveilled in daily life. The unprecedented amounts of data swept up by private surveillance networks give corporations the information necessary to feed development of new products, and adopt manipulative marketing techniques, without any respect for privacy, or even the illusion that people could opt in, or out, of the system.

This surveillance has led to the most intimate details of our lives being monetized and our daily whereabouts tracked. Once companies have gathered this private, sensitive data, it becomes subject to misuse in ways users could never have anticipated.

The FTC must ban the use, sale, and dissemination of facial recognition technology, and institute human rights-based protections that give people full autonomy and control over their personal information and digital bodies, including image, voice, and whereabouts.

= Data Minimization:

""Accept all"" policies are NOT a meaningful or informed consent.

Companies draft privacy language that the majority of the public are unable to read and understand.

The data collected by a company doesn’t always stay with that entity, as companies profit off the sharing of individuals’ data with third-party data brokers.

Data collected and merged, provides companies the ability to predict personal behavior and infer ones' identity, despite industry claims of anonymity. The aggregation of this data allows private entities to conduct discriminatory prediction, which results in biased practices and policies that negatively impact marginalized and vulnerable communities.

To address these issues, the FTC should impose strict data minimization obligations on companies, and ensure that individuals retain maximal control over their own personal data.

= Data security:

After a private entity has collected consumer data, the onus must be on that company to take meaningful steps to ensure the security of that data.

Endless examples of cyberattacks that have exposed peoples’ personal, biometric, financial, and other data highlight how the information companies collect is a target for hackers, data thieves, and other bad actors.

In order to fully protect consumer data, the FTC must require all internet enabled consumer products to employ end-to-end encryption by default.

The FTC should also require companies to regularly perform data privacy, civil rights impact audits to ensure accountability for data security and transparency around breaches and company practices.

The FTC must use its full authority to not only address issues that are prevalent at present, but to proactively protect users in the future as technology and commercial surveillance practices evolve.

Thank you.

In early 2009, I received an envelope from New York Life Insurance Company in my mailbox. It was not a standard mailing sent to “resident” but rather it was addressed to me. I opened the envelope, and as I began to read the personalized letter, my jaw dropped. First, it expressed congratulations on my wedding, referring to it as “the blessed event.” It also referenced our new home. Then, it talked about how we would be looking ahead to welcome our growing family. In closing, New York Life presented itself as the insurance company for all these needs, and it provided information about its offerings and how to get in touch. It was a precisely targeted marketing letter, using data from many places. While the letter may have seemed innocent, it was entirely inappropriate and upsetting. 

I am a single female homeowner in the state of New York. In 2008, I had lost my father, who had lived in another state. As my father was very dear to me, the loss was devastating, occurring only two and half years after I had lost my dear mother. Since I was responsible for settling the estate, I had arranged for my father’s mail to be forwarded to me. Once the forwarding order expired, I had his address changed to mine so I would not miss anything.  At a time when I was already distraught and had to deal with a large amount of incoming mail, I was reading a letter congratulating me on “the blessed event.” The most recent event had been my father’s death, and it was anything but blessed. Clearly, I was not married to my father, who was deceased, and clearly, no children were to be expected. 

New York Life incorrectly assumed that because we had the same address, my late father and I were married. It failed to realize that there are many reasons for people who are not married to have the same address: my circumstance of receiving mail for a deceased family member, an elderly family member who moves in with another family member for caring purposes, siblings or friends who move in together to save on housing costs, those of any gender who are in a relationship and living together without getting married, and the list goes on. Anyone falling into any of those categories would likely also have been upset to have received such a letter from New York Life. 

After assuming that my late father and I were a married couple (not true), New York Life went on to assume that we would be preparing to have children (preposterous). I’m single woman who did not plan to have kids (certainly not with my late father) and who was, in fact, unable to have them. The underlying assumption was that every married couple wants to have children, which is not true. Even among those who want to have children, many struggle with infertility and/or miscarriages, and not everyone qualifies for adoption. Reading such a letter would likely have been painful to all of them as well. 

With that one inappropriate letter invading my privacy, New York Life went from being a company that I respected to a company that I would never contact for any insurance needs or if others asked me to recommend an insurance company. 

I would greatly appreciate it if the Federal Trade Commission would place limits on the types of personal information that companies can cobble together about individuals for purposes of targeted marketing letters. In the case of New York Life, it was not a company with which I was doing business at all, and I had never opted in to receive any communications from it. Rather, the letter came to me out of the blue in a way that was too personalized and, even worse, grossly inaccurate. What horrifies me is that I was surely not the only person impacted in this way from that massive direct-mail marketing campaign. Please stop these personally invasive marketing practices.

Usernames and passwords were kept in a spreadsheet that I was told only IT staff had access to. Firstly, just because they are IT, it does not mean that should have access to usernames and passwords. Secondly, within a week of being told only IT had access the school printed a paper for every student with their name, username and password that was distributed to teachers to pass out to students in their class. At that point access to what is supposed to be protected data could be seen by teachers and whoever went through the stack of unattended papers. My son brought home his paper and my daughter didn’t get one so either someone else took it or ended up on the floor somewhere.  Whole process was unacceptable.  I spent months with emails and meeting fighting for kids rights to privacy. The amount of time and effort I had to put in to get the Babylon HS IT dept do to the right thing was crazy. They finally conceded the following June (I started my battle in Sept) and kids were permitted to go to IT to change their password. So still issues around this.  Kids should be able to change passwords without school IT intervention. If they feel they were hacked on a Friday night they can’t do anything about until days later when they return to school. Also, the announcement of being able to change their passwords was not communicated effectively. Most parents didn’t even know that their kid’s passwords were not private and secure. IT staff should have manned a table during lunch periods for a week to help facilitate password changes. Password changes should not have been optional. The school has an obligation to educate students on privacy and they continue to fail.  ",,,,,,,

When big companies can keep my data, and the data of my friends and family, including all manner of things — their heart rate, their location, their search history, even the number of seconds that we look at an ad — companies become stalkers, manipulators, and poised to create an unfathomable amount of harm. Already, there is major discrimination built into these systems; facial recognition is biased and frequently malfunctions for people of color and women. But even as these technologies improve their accuracy, that makes their store of data stronger. They are more able to track down every movement of everyone on the planet — and that’s terrifying. Why should Target or Walmart have access to my location or my biometric data? Why should big companies have access to information so personal I don’t regularly share it with my friends and family? As we’ve seen with the Uyghurs in China, when you can combine biometric data and location, governments (or companies) can discriminate hyper-specifically against a specific racial group. Data gathering and its uses aren’t transparent, nor regulated properly at present. 

I’m terrified at the amount of power companies already have, and will absolutely have if we do not limit their ability to collect all kinds of data. My friends and family won’t be safe if this goes unchecked. ",,,,,,,

To the Federal Trade Commission:

As an academic researcher, I write to offer perspective on Question 17, “For example, is it an unfair or deceptive practice when a company uses these techniques despite evidence or research linking them to clinical depression, anxiety, eating disorders, or suicidal ideation among children and teenagers?”

The research literature linking heavy social media use to depression, anxiety, self-harm, and suicidal ideation is extensive. It is summarized here (in a continually updated Google doc complied by Jonathan Haidt and myself):

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w-HOfseF2wF9YIpXwUUtP65-olnkPyWcgF5BiAtBEy0/edit

I have attached several scientific journal articles reporting these findings. In summary, most studies find that children and teens who spend excessive amounts of time on social media are between 50% and 200% more likely than light users to experience depression, self-harm, or suicidal ideation. In addition, several longitudinal and experimental studies (included in the Google doc) demonstrate that causation moves from social media use to mood disorders. 

It is also important to note that these individual-level studies do not take group-level effects into account. For example, over the same time that social media use surged among teens, their rates of clinical-level depression doubled (in, for example, the National Survey of Drug Use and Health). The increases began around 2012, long before the pandemic and just as daily social media use became common among teens. The environment created by pervasive social media use has coincided with a mental health crisis among American youth.

Thank you very much for your attention to this very important issue.

We welcome the opportunity to submit the following in response to the Federal Trade Commission’s August 22, 2022 request for comments regarding its Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) on commercial surveillance and data security practices. We are a group of international experts in the areas of children’s digital technologies, ethics, law and policy, specializing in video games and privacy. We are currently collaborating on a multi-year investigation of the reach and impact of commercial surveillance and other under-regulated industry practices in children’s video games and apps. (The Children and Age-Appropriate Game Design project is funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC). Dr. Jayemanne's contributions are funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council no. AH/S002871/1 (InGAME: Innovation for Games and Media Enterprise).) We are contributing to this call for comments because the US is a global leader in the video game industry, and because US policies are far-reaching and often set the tone for regulation and industry standards of practice in other countries.

We have answered questions b, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 21, and 22. Our full responses give greater context and rationale to the positions for which we advocate here. While the majority of our recommendations and rationales are rooted in evidence pertaining to children’s video games, we believe that they capture more generalizable issues surrounding commercial surveillance and children. Indeed, video games and the data science practices that feature in today’s gaming environment are the product of cross-fertilization between other data-intensive industries. Our research and extensive knowledge of the children’s tech industries, regulatory trends, and children’s own experiences of the digital environment informs our responses to the ANPR.

Best regards,

Michael J. S. Beauvais, Sara M. Grimes, Darshana Jayemanne, and Seth Giddings

Many American service members use the app frequently, and this gives foreign actors a free window into our military and its personnel. It is a slippery slope when the FTC continues to allow companies and entities of all shapes and sizes to track every facet of a person's life, and it begins to challenge the Constitution's protections on individual privacy. Terms of service frequently are too long or too complicated for consumers to properly read and understand what they are signing on to, and while it's necessary, it also seems nefarious and intentional. People that are more at-risk, like the older population, continually get hurt by these lax laws. When data is breached or hacked, which has started to happen with increased frequency, lax data laws allow hackers to gain access to a litany of personal and private information. As AI continues to get used more and more, the pitfalls grow stronger, with AI even preferring center genders or races over the other, furthering this notion that tracking and surveillance only seek to further divide people into neat and easy profiles. Even biometric data is now sold to the highest bidders. In order to protect the American people and uphold American's constitutional right to privacy, the FTC must act now to counteract the increasingly runaway tracking and surveillance that nearly every modern company engages in. Listed below are some of the most important (and dangerous) facets of surveillance and tracking that must be considered. 

-Companies that engage in collecting biometric data (like DNA genealogy testing)
-Social media apps (especially from foreign countries like TikTok)
-Healthcare companies
-Insurance companies",,,,,,,

Dear Chair Khan,

The Center for American Progress applauds the decision of the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) to fulfill its mission of protecting consumers and competition by scrutinizing commercial surveillance and data security practices. 

For the average American, these practices are ubiquitous, unavoidable, and unwanted. For many companies, the use of deceptive and harmful practices by some creates a race to the bottom on privacy and data protection for entire industries. On both fronts, intervening to protect consumers and competition is highly consistent with the core mission and authority of the Commission. 

We appreciate the invitation to comment on this project and respectfully offer several ideas for your consideration. 

Please see attached document.

The focus on journalists is deliberate because we see journalists as critical to debunking and labeling misinformation. Also, we’ve developed our tool using a design process that involves interviewing and observing journalists research a story so our deepfake detection tool can easily be inserted into their regular newsgathering practices.
 
Deepfakes are artificially generated images. The process of making a deepfake involves transforming a “source”  (an original real audio visual) to something new. It is doing, the source is manipulated. In addition to the concern about whether or not the “source” consents to the manipulation, rule proposals sound consider who is responsible for securing “source” material? In other words, who is liable if someone’s image is taken and repurposed without their consent?
 
It is my belief that platforms should be responsible for protecting source images and detecting deepfakes. Detection technology isn’t ready for this scale yet, but it’s also true that social media companies have not invested resources and efforts to try to implement a system.
 
In our tool development process with journalists, we see a strong desire to prevent the spread of misinformation. However, it is important to note that journalists are also afraid that if they put their name on a story debunking a deepfake, they might become a target for the creators of the deepfake. This creates a chilling effect and raises security concerns about journalists physical and mental health. This is one reason I believe the government should actively help regulate, monitor and investigate deepfakes, including supporting the development of different deepfake detection tools. Because technology changes rapidly, the more people working on this, the better.
 
I believe that administrating notice or disclosure requirements should fall on governments, companies, and journalists. The more opportunities to educate the public, the better.",,,,,,,

Now that the Saudi government has secured a major share in Twitter, the risk of surveillance and espionage is even greater—and it doesn’t help that Elon Musk’s inability to competently manage Twitter is eviscerating the company.3

That’s why the FTC must take advantage of this opportunity to adopt comprehensive privacy rules that will govern online data collection, usage, and sharing. Our freedom of speech is in danger because Twitter and other corporations fail to encrypt our DMs and protect users’ privacy. It’s time for the FTC to make this failure to encrypt illegal.  ",,,,,,,

2) Clarity of what if being done with the data, is it for internal purposes or is it being re-sold and to whom, and where, and confirmation of what required and optional data protection regulations are being adhered to.  Point 2a on this is if a company is making money of my data, maybe I should get a cut, or, back to point 1, companies should be clear:  this service, site etc is free to you, but we are monetizing your data on the back-end to pay out bills
3) Collected personal data should have some kind of expiration date",,,,,,,

Understanding relationships and motivations, pressures and power controls. How companies, people, entities will intimidate and leverage using strength in resources and influence. How they do this using digital platforms and existing accepted legal practices to justify it.  Employee retaliation, contracts, NDA’s and other mechanisms of privacy infraction to capture information in a “leading the witness” type approach. The real question to these and other efforts in privacy and security I believe is to ask ourselves and the industries:

An ""opt-out"" approach is like someone just walking through the front or back door of my home without being invited in. These virtual entities can figuratively wander around my virtual home, look in my virtual desk, kitchen cabinets, refrigerator, wallet etc. Even if I ""opt out"" and lock the front door, it which won’t protect me from invasion through an unlocked window or back door.

As is my legal right in my actual home, nobody should enter my virtual home unless I allow it with an “opt in” and virtually open the door.

Many people have submitted public comments expressing views similar to mine: in short, that individuals have almost no visibility into what pieces of data and metadata get collected about them and their behavior, and they have little to no agency into what that data gets used for, and how, and for how long. These facts represent a direct threat to individual freedom, collective well-being, physical and psychological safety, and the democratic process itself [Privacy is Power, by Carissa Véliz].

To these points, I would like to share a specific anecdote that I feel is illustrative of the problem:

In late 2019, I found myself needing to buy a car. As a software engineer with an interest in privacy, I was well aware of the consumer data issues at play in the automotive industry. Newer cars collect untold amounts of telemetry and can transmit that telemetry to the manufacturer (or anyone else) without my knowledge or consent. Beyond that, simply dealing with an automotive manufacturer comes with unwanted data gathering and monetization. Consider this quote from former Ford CEO Jim Hackett on the Freakonomics podcast in 2018 (source attached):

""[...] we already know and have data on our customers. [...] We know what people make. How do we know that? It’s because they borrow money from us. And when you ask somebody what they make, we know where they work; we know if they’re married. We know how long they’ve lived in their house, because these are all on the credit applications. We’ve never ever been challenged on how we use that. And that’s the leverage we’ve got here with the data.""

With this knowledge of the possible use (and misuse) of data about me, I was highly motivated to make a car purchase that respected my rights and wishes with regards to my data. However, after weeks of research, I found almost no information from any car manufacturer or dealer with regards to any of these issues. Nothing on what my data would be used for or who it would be sold to, nothing on which cars would be collecting telemetry and what telemetry they would be collecting, nothing regarding the lifecycle or protection of data that would be attached to me in perpetuity. It was impossible for me, as a knowledgeable and motivated consumer, to make a properly informed decision. And I suspect, had I been able to get all the information I wanted, there would have been no options available on the market that respected my wishes.

I would ask the FTC to consider rules and other actions that allow people like myself to engage with modern society (e.g. buying and driving a car) without sacrificing our privacy and liberty.",,,,,,,

Executive Summary

Interdisciplinary researchers at the University of Washington have explored many of the questions posed by the Federal Trade Commission in its recent Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on commercial surveillance and data security practices. 

These comments relay recent findings by faculty in computer science and engineering, information science, social work, and law that are directly responsive to the Commission’s inquiries into (a) biometric and other commercial surveillance practices, (b) lax security measures, (c) harms to vulnerable populations such as children, racial minorities, and the elderly, (d) disparate impacts of algorithms, and (e) the prospect of cost-benefit analysis in privacy regulation.
Insights from these comments include:

- The unexpected ways companies like Amazon leverage consumer interactions with smart speakers to deliver targeted online advertising.
- Privacy and security vulnerabilities in online genetic services such as GEDmatch.
- The unmet privacy and data security expectations of older consumers in elder care technology.
- TikTok content devoted to helping viewers track and surveil others with technology.
- The higher prevalence of certain “dark patterns” in apps used by children with lower socioeconomic status.
- The disparate impact of differential pricing in ride-sharing applications like Uber.
- Advice on how to reconcile public access to data with privacy and data security.

The undersigned researchers hope to continue to be a resource to the FTC as it tackles the important question of how to safeguard the privacy and security of American consumers. Please see the attached file for our full comments.

I'm a second-year law student from Brooklyn, New York, and I'm here to speak out against commercial surveillance practices and lax security measures, especially in the age of social media. The first thing I would like to do is thank you for giving me the opportunity to comment and participate in this rulemaking process. As for the second point, I would like to commend you for making a concerted effort to protect consumer data from misuse.
It is no secret that social media has changed the world. No matter how old you are, how young you are, or where you are in life, social media is essential to your everyday life. While it is a powerful tool for staying in touch with family, friends, and the world, it has become a dangerous place for our privacy. Several social networking companies collect sensitive information about individuals, such as their interests, physical characteristics, political views, purchasing habits, and online behavior. Data like this is often used for financial or personal gain, and its use is discriminatory. 
At this point, we all know what it's like to see an advertisement on a social media platform for a product totally unrelated to that platform, but a product we've explored elsewhere. This is a very invasive practice that is simply wrong. Several social media companies, including Meta Facebook, collect large amounts of personal information to deliver ""micro-targeted"" advertisements. The practice commonly referred to as surveillance advertising or behavioral advertising, is extremely harmful to privacy, information flow, and psychological well-being. Their tracking techniques allow them to follow individuals across various apps, websites, and devices, which explains why they advertise products entirely unrelated to their platform.
These practices are extremely harmful to consumers because the information is being used for reasons unknown to the person. It makes consumers more suspectable to identity theft and fraud which can have a detrimental effect on the consumer. Beyond that, the world is full of people who sometimes want to physically and emotionally harm others. It is extremely scary to know that they may have access to my data privacy and can possibly use it against me. Thus, implementing data security was long overdue and for the concerns stated above, there needs to be some resolution.

There is a trust that if you can buy it, it is safe. But regulation of these matters has not kept pace with the level of technology we face today. So yes, throw the book at this stuff.  ",,,,,,,

Surveillance is invasive and to what end? To sell me consumeristic things that I do not need, made with cheap material at the expense of people and the planet.
Surveillance for safety makes sense.
Surveillance to remove guns from the hands of people that do not need them makes sense.
Surveillance to ensure leaders are not above reproach or the law, that makes sense.
Surveillance by means to market, exploit, co-opt, deny basic human needs seems anti-American.
Surveillance praying on information that was taken without my knowledge in order to send me paper marketing in order to sell me something is a horrible waste of both information and resources.
We should ask ourselves to what end does allowing entities unlimited access to all means of data that is often taken without knowledge and sold? If the end goal is consumerism, waste, theft, and denying people care / service based on that harvested data, then it should be unrestricted.
If the hope is to protect people, afford people privacy, limit consumerism and waste, limit the exploitation of both people and information there should be regulation of the information corporations should get to have about me.
If you will not limit known harmful toxins in my lotion, why should that same company that profits off my harm have access to my personal data in order to profit further.
Surveillance by means to provide a great user experience or personalization is a ruse, it is to sell me things, often things I do not need.",,,,,,,

I have to leave my ""smart"" tv unplugged because I like my privacy.  Counterpoint, well then don't buy a ""smart"" tv, you, I want to enjoy a good picture too when watching a film.

These manipulative companies are inefficient for life, liberty, and independence and need eradicated.  Apple for example, whatever you share privately with another they say you're sharing with apple and apple can do whatever it wants with it and not pay the content creator a fucking dime.  That's theft and slavery.  You don't work for free.  These companies use your private information against you that is detrimental to your well-being.  They exploit and prey on the weaknesses of others to their benefit and not for the well-being of the user.  Custom experiences have polarized the nation and are a threat to democracy and AMERICA, LAND OF THE FREE!  These companies need to buck up, sell a great product that's made in America, and stop selling our privacy to the CCP that's actively working to destroy life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  I demand the invasion of our privacy to stop.  STOP KILLING AMERICA, STOP KILLING WHAT I LOVE!  FREEDOM FOR ALL OR THERE IS NONE!  As long as there's people enslaved there is no freedom.

Thank you for the opportunity to submit comments in response to the Federal Trade Commission's Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) on a Trade Regulation Rule on Commercial Surveillance and Data Security. We offer the following submission for your consideration in the attached PDF.
 
We are researchers affiliated with the Georgia Institute of Technology’s Digital Media program, with expertise in human-computer interaction, privacy, social impacts of Emotion AI, and ethics.
 
In the attached PDF, we provide in-depth comments in response to Questions 4, 6, 37, 38, 53, 56, 73, 74 as outlined in the request for comments. 
 
Overall, we emphasize that mechanisms that fixate on individual harms and personal injury may fail to change individual consumer behavior, fail to address group- and societal-level harms, and perpetuate social inequities in the use of digital services. We discuss these points and potential paths forward in relation to commercial surveillance practices, biometric technologies, algorithmic systems, and consent practices. 
 
We appreciate the opportunity to comment on the Federal Trade Commission’s ANPR.

Given that the protections of the affordable care act are in danger, one might for see a time when pre-existing conditions again, Ken bar coverage, or prevent enrollment and health insurance at all. In New York City public schools, various assessments and screeners are done by private companies, who have no or little obligation to families, wishing to opt out of having their data collected. In fact, there have already been breaches in the past couple years that leaked data tied to students. One of those screeners concerns me deeply, the Desa screener is required by many schools and is a social emotional evaluation tool. There is zero way to see what the date is being used for in the company does not respond to requests for information. If a student is flagged as a social or emotional risk, or as having a mental health issue, this date, I could follow them for a lifetime without their family’s consent. 

Is the affordable charact disappears, those students might lose the ability to have health insurance cover mental health services if the data gets bought by a health insurance company. To my knowledge, there is no legislation that defines what resources ensures may use to determine eligibility. I am deeply concerned and feel the data on minors should not be collected at all and companies must put data collection consent in plain language, instead of in user agreements that are designed to be deliberately opaque ",,,,,,,

I believe that only express opt-in by adults should be the requirement for companies to save any collected data as well as a separate opt in required for permission to market to the adult, and to another opt in to allow them to share the adult's information anywhere.  No data collection and marketing to children should be permitted.  I support the implementation of a nation-wide equivalent to the european GDPR to allow people to better control the information that they do share with various companies.

	 I am writing in support of new trade regulation rules that would apply to currently unregulated data collection and data security. I believe that unregulated data collection has resulted in discrimination practices and algorithms that primarily impact marginalized communities of color. 
	The lack of regulation surrounding data collection combined with the growing utilization of data algorithms has resulted in an alarming pattern of racial discrimination within the housing sector in the United States. Unregulated and unknown algorithms utilized by loan and mortgage companies have statistically been shown to deny people of color over white applicants who share similar financial circumstances. Discriminatory algorithms have also been shown to discriminate against renters using algorithms that disqualify applicants based on the presence of criminal records.  Additionally, many of these applications were denied based on mysterious and unknown algorithms that are completely hidden from the public. Because these algorithms are hidden, applicants are never informed why their applications were denied.  
The unregulated practice of data collection and usage has contributed to these racially discriminatory practices in the housing sector that demonstrate “unfair and deceptive practices” as described in 15 U.S. C. § 57a and therefore I strongly urge the FTC to implement regulations to monitor data surveillance and usage that specifically focuses on addressing the use of discriminatory data algorithms. I encourage the FTC to implement rules that require these mortgage, loan, and rental companies to make their use of data and algorithms public knowledge, so that applicants may be fully aware of why they were denied and have the ability to appeal these decisions. I believe that the FTC should also require these companies to be transparent on how they are utilizing consumer data and making decisions to approve or deny loan applicants.

The Center for Digital Democracy, Fairplay, and #HalfTheStory, American Academy of Pediatrics, Becca Schmill Foundation, Berkeley Media Studies Group, Children and Screens: Institute of Digital Media and Child Development, Consumer Federation of America, Consumer Federation of California, CUNY Urban Food Policy Institute, Eating Disorders Coalition for Research, Policy & Action, Enough is Enough, LookUp.live, Lynn’s Warriors, National Eating Disorders Association, Parents Television and Media Council, ParentsTogether, Peace Educators Allied for Children Everywhere (P.E.A.C.E.), Public Citizen and UConn Rudd Center for Food Policy & Health appreciate that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is looking closely at the prevalence of commercial surveillance and data security practices that harm consumers. As outlined below, we urge the Federal Trade Commission to propose a rule prohibiting the prevalent, unfair, and deceptive practice of surveillance advertising to minors. Further, we ask that the trade regulation rules adopted by the Commission limit commercial surveillance of minors. 

As we demonstrate in our comments, children and teenagers experience widespread commercial surveillance practices to collect data used to target them with marketing. Targeted and personalized advertising remains the dominant business model for digital media, with the marketing and advertising industry identifying children and teens as a prime target. Minors are relentlessly pursued while, simultaneously, they are spending more time online than ever before. Children’s lives are filled with surveillance, involving the collection of vast amounts of personal data of online users. This surveillance, informed by behavior science and maximized by evolving technologies, allows platforms and marketers to profile and manipulate children.

The prevalence of surveillance advertising and targeted marketing aimed at minors is unfair in violation of Section 5. Specifically, data-driven marketing and targeted advertising causes substantial harm to children and teens by:
•	violating their privacy;
•	manipulating them into being interested in harmful products;
•	undermining their autonomy
•	perpetuating discrimination and bias;
Additionally, the design choices tech companies use to optimize engagement and data collection in order to target marketing to minors further harm children and teens. These harms include undermining their physical and mental wellbeing and increasing the risk of problematic internet risk. These harms cannot reasonably be avoided by minors or their families, and there are no countervailing benefits to consumers or competition that outweigh these harms.

Surveillance advertising is also deceptive to children, as defined by the Federal Trade Commission. The representations made about surveillance advertising by adtech companies, social media companies, apps, and games are likely to mislead minors and their parents and guardians. These misrepresentations and omissions are material. Many companies also mislead minors and their guardians by omission because they fail to disclose important information about their practices. These practices impact the choices of minors and their families every day as they use websites, apps, and services without an understanding of the complex system of data collection, retention, and sharing that is used to influence them online. We therefore urge the Commission to promulgate a rule that prohibits targeted marketing to children and teenagers.

The complexity of the surveillance advertising apparatus and its omnipresence in Americans’ lives render it unavoidable for children and teens. The FTC has the necessary legal authority to make rules protecting children and teens from harmful online practices related to commercial surveillance. We urge the Commission to prohibit data-driven surveillance advertising and marketing to individuals under 18. We propose rule text in Appendix A, as well as additional standards to advance data practices in the best interests of young people in Appendix B.

 The harms caused by widespread, unregulated corporate surveillance and data abuses pose a direct threat to the public at large, and can disproportionately discriminate against people of color, women, members of the LGBTQ+ community, religious minorities, persons with disabilities, economically disadvantaged, immigrants and other marginalized groups. In our post-Roe world, these threats have become more significant for people who can get pregnant. These widespread harms directly result from the unfair and deceptive mass collection, use, and sharing of peoples’ data.

I fully support the FTC in exercizing the full extent of its authority to address the entire life cycle of data—collection, use, management, retention, and deletion—in order to provide people with significant protection from discrimination and related data harms. Here are some specific actions I urge the FTC to take:
      dispose of the false premise that “accept all'' policies are in any way a sign of meaningful or informed consent.
   abate aggregation of data that allows private entities to conduct discriminatory prediction, which results in biased practices and policies that negatively impact marginalized and vulnerable communities. 
   impose strict data minimization obligations on companies and ensure that individuals retain maximal control over their own personal data.
   regulate companies to take meaningful steps to ensure the security of that data. they have or have collected.
   proactively protect users in the future as technology and commercial surveillance practices evolve.

 I thank the FTC for launching this rulemaking process and support its efforts to address the harms of surveillance and data abuses.",,,,,,,

In this response for request for comments of Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for commercial surveillance and data
security by FTC [1], we try to provide a simplified intuitive suggested solution for the currently seemingly un-tamable problem
of online and mobile data collection practices for the purpose of commercial surveillance. Such data collection practices are
omnipresent and can be aggressive, non-discriminatory, and non-selective. They have been enabled and driven by the introduction
and the development of the interconnected B2C marketplace in the last 20 plus years. Based on the what have been highlighted
in this notice and widespread evidences, we argue that, we, as a society , may very well be at a critical turning point in terms
of commercial surveillance. While the regulation challenges seem to be so big, inaction may lead to a path of no returns of a
future filled with persistent privacy violations and data leaks. However, there seem to have no ready to serve solutions available
for such a critical problem at a critical juncture. Instead of sourcing limited availability of supported data and research at an
even remotely comparable scale, we attempt to use multiple conceptual comparison frameworks and metaphors to address such
a colossal problem and come up with solutions. For example, we apply an ”epidemic” metaphor for lax commercial surveillance
and data security, not too much un-akin to Covid-19 [2], [3], [4]. Such conceptual frameworks, though seems far-fetched, are
backed by popular and professional sentiments and comments by the Commission. Particularly, we found that the extensive recent
researches of estimating Covid death [3], [4] can be great sources of inspirations for the research of harms associated with lax data
security associated with commercial surveillance. Based on these conceptual frameworks, we have identified a potential solution
and three specific areas of deeper and immediate concerns. Those are commercial surveillance and security breaches related to
children, including teenagers, surveillance leading to discrimination based on protected categories, and surveillance involving
healthcare and personal health data. We then argue in turn to develop new and suitable criteria and adopt a two stage approach
of implementing the proposed regulatory framework with first concentrating in one or all of the above three areas. The proposed
solution can be implemented for a limited time first and then evaluated against old and new criteria for successes against lax
commercial surveillance and data security before applying to the whole marketplace to be better regulated.",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/FTC-2022-0053-1169/attachment_1.pdf",

We are Check My Ads Institute, the ad tech industry’s watchdog. We recognize the value of data in the global economy and view it as a tool in relation to the programmatic ad tech supply chain, a crucial vehicle for modern disinformation and propaganda campaigns.

Lax data security regulations and a lack of enforcement of relevant laws exacerbate the risk of data breaches for consumers. The current piece-by-piece approach to regulating unfair and deceptive practices leaves companies guessing, the FTC without a uniform mechanism for enforcement, and consumers with little recourse. 

As a reference point, we look to the Federal Trade Commission Act[1] and the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)[2], which applies to any data processing operations within the EU. We urge the FTC to implement similar regulations in the US. Here, we offer recommendations as building blocks for the FTC’s potential regulation of commercial data and promotion of expected conduct in the privacy sphere. 

As it stands, several states, including California[3], Colorado[4], Utah[5], and Virginia[6], have their own data privacy laws modeled after the GDPR. The GDPR uses the rule of least privilege to determine applicable jurisdiction and enforcement, taking into account both the company and user location. We recommend that the FTC enforces its rules at an interstate level using a procedure analogous to the GDPR’s use of the rule of least privilege. For example, California has its own broad data broker registration requirement; thus, data brokers operating globally who are not registered in California are in violation of state laws and, by proxy, violate FTC authority against unfair and deceptive practices. The FTC should codify procedures for such circumstances where company location and user location are key determinants in jurisdiction and enforcement. 

Users often face deceptive messaging when entering communication and consent agreements— often referred to as “terms of service.” In addition to the wide use of deceptive language, undisclosed scope, and take-it-or-leave-it agreements, common harmful business practices also include negative option operations. We urge the FTC to create an enshrined user consent policy supplemental to the recently published statement on the enforcement of negative option marketing[7]. Codified procedures and regulatory enforcement will ensure that businesses clearly define permissions to collect user data, inform their users of data collection types and use cases, as well as offer an explicit option to revoke consent. 

Data is made vulnerable by unfair practices throughout its entire lifecycle. This includes data in its resting state. As a current widespread practice, businesses outsource data storage to third parties with unknown or even contradictory privacy policies. Recently, the FTC took action against Chegg Inc. for failure to protect user data. In the relevant complaint, the FTC demanded that Chegg provide a front-end option for users to request the deletion of their data at will[8]. In another case against Weight Watchers, the FTC demanded that any algorithms based on children’s user data collected without adequate parental consent via their Kurbo App be deleted[9].

Unfortunately, there is no codified procedure to ensure algorithmic deletion has taken place. In both of the aforementioned cases, the FTC ordered deletion. However, the companies never proved that the data was actually deleted or how they did so. This has created a loophole for businesses to insist undefined action has been taken. To better protect user data and privacy against unfair practices that go beyond case-by-case enforcement, the FTC must establish a clear process to prove that algorithmic destruction is adequately undertaken. Such a process may include time-restricted data retention, deletion audits, and inheritance disclosures where relevant.

The harms of unfair and deceptive business practices in the underregulated commercial surveillance space are realized by the current FTC vs. Kochava case. This case established that geolocation data and location pattern data may be sold in formats that are easily de-anonymized, as they are often tied to device IDs or other identifying characteristics[10]. Data that is easily de-anonymized subjects people to material risk outside the scope of what users could reasonably comprehend. Consent, in this case, was unclear and, therefore, invalid. The sale of data acquired through deceptive practices, which was then improperly stored, violated the FTC Act, 15 USC § 45(a)(4)[1]. This empowers the FTC to seek damages against the infringing party. As a model case, we encourage the FTC to hold companies accountable for first-time violations of the FTC Act, leading the way to potential national regulation, codifying, and expanding on prior decisions.

Thank you for your attention to this important matter. 

Sincerely,

Check My Ads Institute

In summary:

Consent is a vital complement to data minimization and completely prohibiting some commercial surveillance activities.  Opt-out is not meaningful affirmative consent, and an opt-in approach to regulation will enhance innovation. (Questions 26, 73-81)

Algorithmic error and discrimination is pervasive across multiple sectors – and the harms fail disproportionately on the most vulnerable people. (Questions 53, 57, 65, 66, 67)

The FTC should build on the recommendations of Algorithmic Justice League’s Who Audits the Auditors, the White House OSTP’s Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights, and the California Privacy Protection Agency’s AI equity work. (Questions 41-46, 56, 67)

The FTC should develop its regulations working with the people most likely to be harmed by commercial surveillance – and prioritize their needs. (Questions 29, 39, 43)

I am particularly worried (and I am sure many other people are, too) about social media platforms based in the USA, such as Twitter, not bothering to bolster their lax privacy regulations.

Recently, the royal Saudi family secured a large share in Twitter, and there has been a case of a Twitter ex-employee selling personally-identifiable data of dissidents and critics of the authoritarian Saudi government to said royal family (which is a case of commercial surveillance). It has become very clear how little Twitter values its users’ freedom of speech and safety.

Such data breaches make Twitter, and other social media users, question whether their own privacy may be at risk as well. Who is to say that an unscrupulous hacker, Twitter employee, or other party won’t abuse Twitter or other online platforms to expose us, dox us, and sell our data to malicious, irresponsible persons or entities?

While I do understand that the Federal Trade Commission cannot protect absolutely everyone in danger at all times from these worrisome situations as it is an organization with so much manpower and resources available, it can certainly legally require USA-based companies and corporations, such as Twitter, to encrypt users’ direct messages, other kinds of messages intended to remain private, and other data that they collect and process from users, with end-to-end encryption. Social media companies should not be given free rein to unnecessarily collect our data, or handle our data and personal information in a careless way.

Since it would be almost impossible to convince a regular person to believe the kind of experiences that I undergo on a daily basis, I would spare the details and stick to the data part of this phenomenon. Please note that I would not have believed some one making such a claim previous to the realization of my existence as an experimentee. 

One would agree that a human being could have an existence that might be of interest to various research organizations that are constantly striving for finding cures for diseases or corporations that are developing modern technology like implantable devices for example. How many of these humans would be willing or has time for making themselves available to test a new experimental medication, a brain technology that could be used on the front lines by a defense contractor or a device that needs to be implanted and observed over several months or even years for it's safety? But if one is keen enough in their observations through their daily existence, it is obvious that there are a multitude of new medical devices and cures being offered in the current times. Is there any transparency to the data related to the ""testing part"" of these devices/technologies?

Now comes the various data collectors of these unsuspecting humans who are going about their daily lives. Their data is collected through various means by their ISPs, Mobile Phone networking companies, Health Insurance companies, Medical providers and their Employers just to name a few. While the data might not make a story on the side of the individual corporation that collects it, it definitely creates a profile when put together, that can be sold to various other organizations that have research interests, like a University that is researching a certain cure for a medical condition that a particular individual is suffering from to cite as an example.
 
While most of what I describe here is common knowledge, as an individual who has recognized existing human experimentation being done on unwitting humans, the difference is the existence of residential neighborhoods that has various actors who are either residents themselves or other entities that are able to control and affect the experimentees and their daily situations/activities. There is huge financial gains to be made and any expenditure to facilitate these research activities in a covert manner would be of negligible cost. This is just a tip of the ice berg of all the possible exploitation that are being done on these humans who cannot protect themselves as they will be dismissed as ""disillusioned"" or ""delusional"" and please note there are mental health laws that are available for abuse as well.

Copy pasted here is a report on human experimentation that is being investigated by DOJ at a nursing home in Iowa. 
https://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/ny-iowa-nursing-home-experimenting-residents-20201223-ssekej6yfbhtrmqg56xilapvma-story.html
This is just one of the few cases that has come to light. 

What can the FTC do? 
There are many useful laws existing in the United States to protect it's residents/citizens. But how much of these laws are enforceable? And what are the reasons contributing to unenforceability of the laws?

When there is no accountability to the extend of data that could be collected, it becomes impossible to find faults with the data collection. When the data is collected through indirect means or covert methods, again it is not possible to prove that there is invasion of privacy or any malpractice taking place. 

Suggestions:
FTC should have their own Cyber Security Department consisting of high level experts that would conduct tests direct and indirect on various commercial entities on the methods employed for data collection and the type of intrusive methods that they are capable of employing in their data collection practice or on how they use it. If it is not the scope of FTC, then they should contract with Cyber Security Specialists or take services from such entities in order to ensure the practices listed above. They should have a means to review the existing control methods to include unforeseen situations that arise with the advent of more advanced use of technology used in data collection as time passes by.

Please note that it has been a great privilege that the citizens of United States have experienced through the renewed efforts that FTC has employed, especially providing a public forum like this to initiate a dialogue to protect the rights of citizens. This is greatly appreciated and hope to see some solid changes happening once FTC comes up with stricter laws to curtail the invasiveness of the extensive data collection that is currently employed by the big corporations of US who has power and influence of the highest order.",,,,,,,

The Commission’s ANPRM states a desire to address the ways in which Americans are surveilled in “the most basic aspects of modern life,” including their “movements” and “faces.” We believe it is impossible to meaningfully pursue that goal unless the Commission’s proposed rule and ultimate regulations encompass technologies created by private companies and sold to law enforcement. We accordingly urge the Commission to ensure that surveillance technologies sold to police, prisons, jails, and other law enforcement agencies are encompassed within the proposed and final rule.

The attached comment explains the regulatory void that the Commission can fill with respect to the law enforcement surveillance industry. We describe some of the harms that flow from the surveillance technologies that private companies are selling to law enforcement, with detailed reference to specific examples.

Refusing to acknowledge the issues that are being caused by the lack of protections and the purposeful manipulation of the people is unacceptable in an advanced nation like our own with guaranteed freedoms like we have.

Shareaza is a peer-to-peer file transfer service. Users sign an agreement that enables them to use the service to send videos and music to others. Users expect the content of these files, and the hash codes used in their transmission, to remain private based on laws including the Fourth Amendment, Executive Order 12333, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, and the Stored Communications Act. Unfortunately, Shearaza created a program that is exclusively available to law enforcement, Shearaza L.E., which has been used extensively by the ICAC (Internet Crimes Against Children) task force to create the COPS database that inventories the content of people’s private computers without a warrant. This database contains file names, IP addresses, dates and times of peer-to-peer transfers, subscriber information, and hash codes.

This information is described in detail by Bonnie Burkhardt in her book Manufacturing Criminals. Ms. Burkhardt is the Director of Business Intelligence & Analytics at Seton Hall University and is an engineer, intelligence analyst, and expert witness with more than 35 years of experience creating and operating surveillance systems for the DOD. She has obtained her information from court transcripts of testimony and documents filed by law enforcement officers. She notes that whereas law enforcement officers claim that the information they use is in the public domain, it actually is not; the Director of National Intelligence defines publicly available as: “The information must be available to any member of the general public.” ""Publicly available"" pertains not just to the file but also to the information within it. Law enforcement only has access to these files because they carried out an illegal interception; they were not a party to the communications. Moreover, an encrypted file that needs a special law enforcement tool to be read is not publicly available.

Ms. Burkhardt presents evidence that law enforcement officers have also impersonated children to initiate a relationship with someone whose IP address they accessed via the COPS database (files with hash codes that match those law enforcement has labeled as child pornography). Or, they have impersonated a child after obtaining the child's phone from a parent who was concerned about text messages between their child and a stranger. All of these actions are illegal because impersonation itself is illegal, as are the interception of the files, the examination of their content, and the identification of the associated IP addresses by a third party without a warrant. 

Shearaza deceptively modified their user agreement to include user monitoring. Ms. Burkhardt notes that this is an illegal practice according to 18 U.S. Code Section 2511, which states that ""Interception of oral, wire or electronic communications prohibited:
Except as specifically provided in this chapter any person who
(a) Intentionally…procures any other person to intercept…any electronic communication…;
Exception:
(2)(a)(i) It shall not be lawful under this chapter for…a provider… engaged in any activity which is a necessary incident to the rendition of his service…[but] a provider of communication service to the public shall not utilize service observing or random monitoring except for mechanical or service quality control checks.

Several serious repercussions arise from the illegal use of the ICAC COPS database. First, defendants who are accused of child pornography possession or trafficking on the basis of information obtained by law enforcement using Shareaza L.E. are not informed of the source of the evidence. Second, there is no evidence that hash codes correctly identify files that truly are child pornography. This was demonstrated in a recent case in which a father communicated with his child's pediatrician and sent them an image of his child's genital that was swollen. He became the subject of a police investigation that has taken years to resolve (see https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/21/technology/google-surveillance-toddler-photo.html). Third, the ability to access these databases means that they could also be used to investigate any individual that a law enforcement officer chooses, such as their own personal contacts. Fourth, this same database could be used to investigate many other potential crimes, including accessing abortions or guns, or any number of other possible infractions, all without a warrant.

Shareaza L.E. benefits financially from lucrative contracts with ICAC while it engages in illegal and deceptive practices that reveal the highly personal information of their customers. The FTC should investigate and regulate this dangerous enterprise.

_______

My name is Gene and I am the Head of Product for a startup that collects and processes sensitive data. I’ve spent the last 15 years or so working in Product Management roles where I’ve been responsible for the design and delivery of digital products that depend on and generate sensitive data.

It is not in my view an overstatement to suggest that the future of humanity will be impacted directly by the decisions this committee will be making.

What’s at stake is the difference between common prosperity and increasing exploitation of people for profit. Fundamentally, a free and fair society cannot exist without privacy.

The background that you see on my video along with other signals that can be collected from this video feed and my network connection can be used to judge me and put me into various categories, including on the basis of age, sex, and wealth. There are companies now who are selling people on the idea that they can reach far more invasive deductions based on this data, putting people at risk of having their health and mental state judged along with a litany of other factors. In fact, this feed is enough for someone to produce audio and video of my likeness doing anything they want, and the repercussions for doing such things are somewhere between unclear, ineffective, and simply non-existent.

There are too many risks to list that tie to privacy concerns and our collective exposure to data collections and analysis, but I will mention that the proliferation of financial fraud, revenge porn, digital addictions, physical targeting of individuals, and human trafficking can all be mitigated with rules that the FTC can develop and enforce.

I will close with a few examples of concepts that I hope the FTC will consider in its rule making process.

Any company collecting data must have baseline secure systems that are tested for vulnerabilities regularly.

Establish simple rules around retention of all data from and about people. This information cannot be collected without a policy to enforce its deletion at an appropriate time.

Ban emotional manipulation and require that any related data collections is done with informed, but not forced consent with an option to opt out at any time.

Require companies that maintain consumer accounts to let people easily delete them and all associated data that’s not legally required to be retained.

Set up a process to measure the impact of these policies with regular reviews to improve them.

Finally, I would suggest a focus on incentivizing the people and companies who do and want to right by others.

I firmly believe that the path to the continued technological success in this country is through ethical product design and I believe you will find many allies in this effort.

We are here to collaborate. Please help us do the right thing.

Thank you.",,,,,,,

WA People’s Privacy is an organization focused on people’s advocacy, and we want to help communicate the deep concern of WA residents about the issues the FTC has listed so thoroughly here. Overall, we want to urge you to consider both current and future harms, many of which were cogently outlined by speakers in the FTC’s public forum back in September.

People’s privacy is a prerequisite for free, equitable and democratic societies. In this sense, our privacy is worth so much more than corporate growth, and our governing bodies must protect that value. Increased surveillance via mass data collection isn't preventing crime or creating safety. People are weary of the fear-mongering, xenophobic messaging and policies that have been repeatedly employed to justify increasingly invasive commercial surveillance in our daily lives, rather than simply meeting the basic human needs that do prevent harm, create safety, and foster healthy people and communities. Our wellness, rights and liberties are paramount to profit. That is really the point and the heart of any democracy, and if we look at how completely out of balance our privacy is with commercial data surveillance, it’s not an overstatement to say that our American democracy is dangerously off course.

Data collection should be minimized to what is strictly necessary. Entities should be prohibited from using coercive and sneaky methods of collecting and sharing our data. Similar to ALPRs tracking cars everywhere we drive, companies being able tracking devices across platforms leads to all kinds of harms. Where commercial surveillance, Automated Decision Systems, AI and very soon AR and the Metaverse intersect with overreaches of law enforcement and intelligence agencies, existing systemic harms and violence are amplified — and yet, also completely obscured as to  who is responsible for the harm or violence. This is sure to produce a steady slipping away of people’s rights in relation to accessing food, housing, income, jobs and even travel, leisure, and joy!

Reckless data practices replicate and amplify inequities stemming from systemic and historic discrimination. The harms caused by widespread, unregulated corporate surveillance and data abuses pose a direct threat to the public at large, and can disproportionately discriminate against people of color, women, members of the LGBTQ+ community, religious minorities, persons with disabilities, economically disadvantaged, immigrants and other marginalized groups. In our post-Roe world, these threats have become more significant for people who can get pregnant. These widespread harms directly result from the unfair and deceptive mass collection, use, and sharing of peoples’ data.
I fully support the FTC in exercizing the full extent of its authority to address the entire life cycle of data—collection, use, management, retention, and deletion—in order to provide people with significant protection from discrimination and related data harms. Here are some specific actions I urge the FTC to take:
- Commercial surveillance technologies: As surveillance devices flood the market, we’ve seen the installation of the largest private surveillance network in US history. Doorbell cameras, floodlight cameras, AI powered dash cameras, automated license plate readers, facial recognition and other tools of biometric surveillance give corporations roaming eyes in every neighborhood, shopping center, and street in our communities. It’s become nearly impossible to avoid being surveilled in daily life. The unprecedented amounts of data swept up en masse by private surveillance networks give corporations the information necessary to feed development of new products and adopt manipulative marketing techniques without any respect for privacy or even the illusion that people could opt in or out of the system. This surveillance has led to the most intimate details of our lives being monetized and our daily whereabouts tracked. Once companies have gathered this private, sensitive data, it becomes subject to misuse in ways users could never have anticipated. In response to the onslaught of surveillance technologies, the FTC must ban the use, sale, and dissemination of facial recognition technology, and institute human rights-based protections that give people full autonomy and control over their personal information and digital bodies, including image, voice, and whereabouts.
- Data minimization: We must dispose of the false premise that “accept all'' policies are in any way a sign of meaningful or informed consent. Companies draft privacy language that the majority of the public are unable to read and understand. Meanwhile, the data collected by a company doesn’t always stay with that entity, as companies profit off the sharing of individuals’ data with third-party data brokers. Not only do many people not realize this is a common practice, but it is also unlikely they could understand the potential impacts or how this data could be used as it changes hands. As this data is collected and merged, companies are able to predict personal behavior and infer ones' identity, despite industry claims of anonymity. The aggregation of this data allows private entities to conduct discriminatory prediction, which results in biased practices and policies that negatively impact marginalized and vulnerable communities. To address issues with data collection, the FTC should impose strict data minimization obligations on companies and ensure that individuals retain maximal control over their own personal data.
- Data security: After a private entity has collected consumer data, the onus must be on that company to take meaningful steps to ensure the security of that data. Endless examples of cyberattacks that have exposed peoples’ personal, biometric, financial, and other data highlight how the information companies collect is a target for hackers, data thieves, and other bad actors. In order to fully protect consumer data, the FTC must require all internet enabled consumer products to employ end-to-end encryption by default. The FTC should also require companies to regularly perform data privacy, civil rights impact audits to ensure accountability for data security and transparency around breaches and company practices. 
The FTC must use its full authority to not only address issues that are prevalent at present, but to proactively protect users in the future as technology and commercial surveillance practices evolve. I thank the FTC for launching this rulemaking process and support its efforts to address the harms of surveillance and data abuses.",,,,,,,

Re: Commercial Surveillance ANPR, R111004

Dear Federal Trade Commission, 

I am a law student and current resident of New York, who has close connections to people who have been affected by the lack of regulation on private companies’ commercial surveillance. Therefore, I am writing in strong support of the AFT’s proposed rule to create privacy safeguards and enforce new rules on commercial surveillance and data security unfair and deceiving practices. 

I write to you as a deeply concerned citizen and consumer to oppose the pervasive ways that some companies collect our most intimidate and personal information for the purpose of security, as they claim this verifies and secure our online accounts. But the reality is that they sell our personal data to third-party companies without the knowledge of the third-party’s usage or protections for our personal data misusage. Currently, the practices to collect, process, transmit, or sell data are not subject to privacy and security rules. Such collection and gathering of data information are not even informed and consensual. In fact, it is unduly influenced and coercive because many times consumers have not agreed or consented to this practice for many reasons, including people who cannot understand the legal jargon, lengthy terms and conditions, or even explicit denial of consumers.  Other times, consumers are unduly influenced or coerced into agreeing to these terms and conditions to use certain apps because that is really the only option, with no alternatives, this is like putting a gun in their heads. 

Furthermore, these practices and instances occur more often in communities of color with lower levels of education, leaving them more vulnerable to police violence and criminalization, and targeted for cyberattacks, fraudulent banking transactions, or even victims of automated racist algorithms that affect other aspects of their lives. A report from Public Citizen Foundation describes how racist algorithms harm communities of color in areas of housing, insurance, employment, health care, and criminal policing.   For example, the MIT Technology Review’s article states, “there’s a long history of data weaponized against Black communities.”  This means that without regulation, the EFT is a tool to perpetuate systemic racism when the data that algorithms feed upon are racist data based on previous arrest rates. Because Black and Brown neighborhoods have historically been targeted by law enforcement, and every time they stop or arrest someone, they add this data to a database even if the person did not commit a crime. Thus, automated algorithms create false predictive data about the neighborhoods where crime is more likely to occur, and police target again those neighborhoods. This is simply a vicious cycle that needs to be regulated as human prejudices have been embedded into these automated tools creating a disproportionate effect on Black and Brown communities. In 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that “disparate impact” discrimination or disproportionate effect on the basis of protected classes, like race, gender, or disability– is illegal. Not having any privacy regulations and protecting big companies that only monetize people's data information is complicit in ""disparate impact"" discrimination. 

Under 15 U.S.C. 57(a), FTC must take steps to preserve and protect the privacy of citizens by regulating the collection of personal data and protecting it from unfair and deceiving practices. At the very least, the Commission shall establish safeguards of privacy, such as fines to businesses and private companies as a form of accountability (including third-party vendors responsible for the illegal disclosures of consumer data, even if it is unintentional).  These forms of accountability would deter private companies from future unlawful and deceptive practices of personal data that impact communities differently, or at least it would make them think twice about their practices. Other alternatives are also to ban the most unfair and deceptive practices, such as those that are completely invasive, tricky, and coercive, especially those that disproportionally harm Black, Indigenous, and People of Color through new trade regulation rules. 

Sincerely, 
YH
